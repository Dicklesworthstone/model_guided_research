Below is a self‑contained “hyperreal calculus for learning.” Everything is phrased in the *hyperreal field* ${}^\ast\mathbb R$ with the **transfer principle** (first‑order statements true over $\mathbb R$ remain true when all symbols are ${}^\ast$-extended) and the **standard‑part map** $\mathrm{st}$ (sending any limited $x\in{}^\ast\mathbb R$ to the unique $r\in\mathbb R$ with $x\approx r$). No external references are used; only transfer and standard‑part extraction.

---

## 0) Hyperreal preliminaries for learning

* **Numbers and vectors.** ${}^\ast\mathbb R$ contains the reals, **infinitesimals** $\varepsilon$ with $|\varepsilon|>0$ and $\varepsilon\approx 0$, and **infinite** numbers $H$ with $|H|>\!n$ for all $n\in\mathbb N$. Extend coordinatewise to ${}^\ast\mathbb R^d$.
  Write $x\approx y$ iff $x-y$ is infinitesimal; write “limited” for finite‑magnitude elements.
* **Internal vs. external.** Objects obtained by ${}^\ast$-extending standard ones or built by internal comprehension are **internal**; others (e.g., the set of all nearstandard points) can be **external**. **Transfer** applies to internal objects only.
* **Standard part.** For limited $x$, $\mathrm{st}(x)\in\mathbb R$ with $x\approx \mathrm{st}(x)$. Extend componentwise to vectors and matrices.

We will use these to speak about gradients, Lipschitz constants, empirical risks over *hyperfinite* samples, and optimization dynamics at **actual** infinitesimal step sizes.

## 1) Differential calculus (gradients, smoothness) in ${}^\ast\mathbb R$

Let $f:\mathbb R^d\to\mathbb R$ be standard. Its ${}^\ast$-extension ${}^\ast f:{}^\ast\mathbb R^d\to{}^\ast\mathbb R$ is internal.

* **Gradient at nearstandard points (definition).** For limited $x\in{}^\ast\mathbb R^d$, an internal vector $g$ is **the gradient of ${}^\ast f$ at $x$** if for every infinitesimal $h$,

  $$
  \frac{{}^\ast f(x+h)-{}^\ast f(x)-\langle g,h\rangle}{\|h\|}\approx 0.
  $$

  If $x$ is nearstandard ($x\approx \bar x\in\mathbb R^d$) and $f$ is classically differentiable at $\bar x$, transfer gives existence/uniqueness of such $g$ and $g\approx \nabla f(\bar x)$. We then set $\mathrm{st}(g)=\nabla f(\bar x)$.
* **Hessian and higher derivatives** are defined identically via internal multilinear forms; at nearstandard $x$ they shadow the standard derivatives by $\mathrm{st}$.
* **${}^\ast$-Lipschitzness (local and global).** For internal $A\subset {}^\ast\mathbb R^d$, ${}^\ast f$ is **${}^\ast$-Lipschitz on $A$** with constant $L\in{}^\ast\mathbb R_{\ge 0}$ if $|{}^\ast f(x)-{}^\ast f(y)|\le L\|x-y\|$ for all $x,y\in A$.
  If $L$ is limited, $\mathrm{st}(L)$ is a standard Lipschitz constant on $\mathrm{st}(A\cap\text{limited})$.
  Analogously define **${}^\ast$-smoothness**: $\nabla {}^\ast f$ ${}^\ast$-Lipschitz with constant $L$.

> Practical reading: in any nearstandard neighborhood, internal smoothness constants have standard parts equal to the classical ones; internal calculus recovers standard calculus by $\mathrm{st}$.

---

## 2) Data, empirical risk, and generalization via hyperfinite averages

* **Setup.** Let $Z$ be a standard data space with standard distribution $P$. Let a standard loss $\ell:\mathbb R^d\times Z\to\mathbb R$ be measurable; extend to ${}^\ast\ell:{}^\ast\mathbb R^d\times {}^\ast Z\to{}^\ast\mathbb R$. Define the **population risk** $F(w):=\mathbb E_{Z\sim P}\big[\ell(w;Z)\big]$ on $\mathbb R^d$ and the internal **${}^\ast$-population risk** ${}^\ast F:{}^\ast\mathbb R^d\to{}^\ast\mathbb R$ by transfer.
* **Hyperfinite sample and empirical risk.** Let $N\in{}^\ast\mathbb N\setminus\mathbb N$ be infinite. Draw an internal i.i.d. sample $(Z_i)_{i=1}^N$ from the ${}^\ast$-extension of $P$. Define the **hyperfinite empirical risk**

  $$
  {}^\ast F_N(w):=\frac1N\sum_{i=1}^N {}^\ast\ell(w;Z_i).
  $$
* **Pointwise generalization (law of large numbers by transfer).** If $\mathbb E|\ell(w;Z)|<\infty$ for standard $w$, transfer of the strong law yields, for each standard $w$,

  $$
  {}^\ast F_N(w)\approx F(w)\quad\text{with \({}^\ast\)-probability one.}
  $$

  Hence $\mathrm{st}({}^\ast F_N(w))=F(w)$.
* **Uniform generalization on compact nearstandard regions.** Suppose for standard compact $K\subset\mathbb R^d$ there is a standard $L$ with $|\ell(w;z)-\ell(w';z)|\le L\|w-w'\|$ for all $w,w'\in K$, $z\in Z$, and $\mathbb E|\ell(w;Z)|<\infty$. By transfer, $K$ admits internal $\delta$-nets of **hyperfinite** size for every standard $\delta>0$. Combining the pointwise statement on the net with Lipschitzness and letting $\delta\to 0$ yields

  $$
  \sup_{w\in K}\,|{}^\ast F_N(w)-F(w)|\approx 0\quad\Rightarrow\quad
  \mathrm{st}\Big(\sup_{w\in K}|{}^\ast F_N(w)-F(w)|\Big)=0.
  $$

  So on standard compact sets, the generalization gap **vanishes exactly** after applying $\mathrm{st}$.

> Practical reading: empirical and population risk coincide after taking standard parts when the sample is hyperfinite (infinitely large) and the parameter set is standard‑compact. This will let us talk about generalization “for free” along infinitesimal training trajectories that remain nearstandard and within compact level sets.

---

## 3) What does “vanishing step size” mean when the step is **actually** infinitesimal?

Consider internal iterative dynamics (plain GD for now)

$$
w_{t+1}=w_t-\varepsilon\,\nabla {}^\ast F(w_t),\qquad t=0,1,\dots,
$$

with a **fixed positive infinitesimal** $\varepsilon$ and $w_0\in\mathbb R^d$ (so $w_0$ is standard).

* **Hyperfinite time → finite macro time.** For $m\in{}^\ast\mathbb N$ hyperfinite, set the **macro time** $\tau_m:=m\varepsilon$. If $m$ is infinite while $\tau_m$ is limited, define the **shadow trajectory**

  $$
  W(\tau):=\mathrm{st}\Big(w_m\Big)\quad\text{for any }m\text{ with }m\varepsilon\approx \tau.
  $$

  (Well‑definedness is below.)

* **Step‑size becomes irrelevant; only elapsed macro time matters.** Assume $\nabla {}^\ast F$ is ${}^\ast$-Lipschitz with limited constant on a nearstandard region containing the trajectory. Then by transfer of Euler consistency and Grönwall‑type stability, for any two positive infinitesimals $\varepsilon,\varepsilon'$ and hyperfinite $m,m'$ with $m\varepsilon\approx m'\varepsilon'\approx \tau$ (limited),

  $$
  \mathrm{st}(w_m)=\mathrm{st}(w'_{m'})=W(\tau).
  $$

  In other words, **all positive infinitesimal step sizes yield the same standard‑part path parameterized by macro time $\tau$**.

* **Connection to gradient flow.** The map $\tau\mapsto W(\tau)$ is the unique standard solution of the ODE

  $$
  \frac{dW}{d\tau}=-\nabla F(W),\qquad W(0)=w_0.
  $$

  (Transfer: the internal Euler scheme with step $\varepsilon$ shadows the ODE solution; taking standard parts collapses the scheme to the exact gradient flow.)

> Takeaway: “vanishing step size” becomes **using any positive infinitesimal**. Tuning $\varepsilon$ is pointless—after $\mathrm{st}$, only the macro time $\tau$ remains. Learning‑rate tuning collapses to **time (early‑stopping) tuning**.

---

## 4) Lipschitzness and curvature at infinitesimal scales (flat vs. sharp minima)

Let $w^\ast$ be a (local) minimizer. Fix a **probing scale** $\rho\in{}^\ast\mathbb R_{>0}$ that may be infinitesimal.

* **Scale‑normalized sharpness.** Define

  $$
  \mathcal A_\rho(w):=\mathrm{st}\!\left(\sup_{\|u\|\le 1}\frac{{}^\ast F(w+\rho u)-{}^\ast F(w)}{\rho^2}\right).
  $$

  If $\nabla {}^\ast F$ is ${}^\ast$-Lipschitz near $w$ with limited constant and ${}^\ast F$ is twice differentiable at nearstandard $w$, then

  $$
  \mathcal A_\rho(w)=\tfrac12\,\lambda_{\max}\!\big(\mathrm{st}(\nabla^2 {}^\ast F(w))\big),
  $$

  independent of the particular infinitesimal $\rho$ used (as long as $\rho$ is positive and infinitesimal).
  **Flatness** at the infinitesimal scale means $\mathcal A_\rho(w)$ is small; **sharpness** means $\mathcal A_\rho(w)$ is large. This pins the notion to the **standard part of curvature**, not to an arbitrary finite step choice.

* **Scale coupling clarified.** Any finite “sharpness” proxy that divides a loss increase by $\eta^2$ implicitly chooses a probing scale $\eta$. In the hyperreal calculus we probe with an actual infinitesimal $\rho$ and then take $\mathrm{st}$; the result depends only on the standard Hessian at $w$. Thus disagreements about flat vs. sharp induced by different finite step sizes disappear.

---

## 5) Generalization from infinitesimal neighborhoods (robust minima)

Let $B_\rho(w):=\{w+\Delta:\|\Delta\|\le \rho\}$. Suppose $\rho>0$ is infinitesimal and optimization remains within a nearstandard compact set.

* **Uniform empirical ≈ population on infinitesimal balls.** From §2, uniformly on $B_\rho(w)\cap$ (nearstandard compact), ${}^\ast F_N(\cdot)\approx F(\cdot)$. Therefore the **generalization gap is infinitesimal uniformly on $B_\rho(w)$**, and its standard part is zero.

* **Flatness → algorithmic stability (at scale $\rho$).** If $\mathcal A_\rho(w^\ast)$ is small, loss changes only by $O(\rho^2)$ under $O(\rho)$ parameter perturbations. Since empirical/population coincide after $\mathrm{st}$, this provides a scale‑explicit route from flatness to stability to generalization, without any discrete step choice contaminating the definition.

---

## 6) Implicit regularization through infinitesimal‑step dynamics

Because step size is infinitesimal, the **standard‑part dynamics** are exactly **gradient flow** (or its preconditioned variants below). This formalizes common implicit biases without tuning $\varepsilon$.

* **Early stopping becomes the regularizer.** For convex $F$, the gradient‑flow solution $\tau\mapsto W(\tau)$ is unique and non‑expansive under suitable smoothness; selecting a macro time $\tau$ picks a unique point on the flow. The “regularizer” is the **flow time** $\tau$: smaller $\tau$ yields smoother (less moved) solutions; $\tau\to\infty$ yields minimizers of $F$.

* **Least‑norm selection in underdetermined linear regression (direct computation).** Let $F(w)=\tfrac12\|Xw-y\|^2$ with $X\in\mathbb R^{n\times d}$. Gradient flow solves

  $$
  \dot W(\tau)=-X^\top(XW(\tau)-y),\quad W(0)=0.
  $$

  Diagonalize in the singular‑value basis to get

  $$
  W(\tau)=X^+\!\,y+\exp(-\tau X^\top X)\big(0-X^+\!\,y\big)\;\xrightarrow{\tau\to\infty}\;X^+\!\,y,
  $$

  the **minimum‑$\ell_2$‑norm interpolant**. Thus, with an actual infinitesimal step, the standard‑part limit recovers the least‑norm bias with **no learning‑rate tuning**; only $\tau$ matters.

* **Preconditioning = metric‑induced bias.** If the internal micro‑update is $w_{t+1}=w_t-\varepsilon\,G(w_t)^{-1}\nabla{}^\ast F(w_t)$ for internal positive‑definite $G$, then the standard‑part trajectory solves

  $$
  \dot W(\tau)=-G(W(\tau))^{-1}\nabla F(W(\tau)),
  $$

  i.e., gradient flow in the Riemannian metric from $G$. The **implicit bias** is the least‑“$G$‑norm” solution in linear settings, again independent of the infinitesimal step.

> Summary: implicit regularization is precisely the bias of continuous‑time (possibly metric‑preconditioned) gradient flow; the role of “learning rate” collapses to choosing the **macro time** $\tau$.

---

## 7) Stochasticity at infinitesimal steps

Consider internal SGD: $w_{t+1}=w_t-\varepsilon\,g(w_t,\xi_t)$, with $\mathbb E[g(w,\xi)]=\nabla {}^\ast F(w)$ and bounded second moment.

* Over $m$ hyperfinite steps with $m\varepsilon\approx\tau$, the cumulative noise is a sum of $m$ mean‑zero terms of size $O(\varepsilon)$. Its magnitude is $O(\sqrt m\,\varepsilon)=O(\sqrt{\tau\varepsilon})$, which is infinitesimal.
  **Therefore the standard‑part trajectory equals deterministic gradient flow.**
  If one wants a **non‑vanishing** diffusion in the standard part, the micro‑noise must be scaled so that its variance over $m$ steps has a limited nonzero standard part (e.g., variance per step $=O(1/\varepsilon)$); absent that, stochasticity washes out after $\mathrm{st}$.

This cleanly separates two regimes: *infinitesimal steps with bounded noise ⇒ deterministic implicit bias; appreciable noise scaling ⇒ diffusion‑type implicit bias*, both formalizable by the same calculus.

---

## 8) Training updates that move by the **standard part of an infinitesimal trajectory**

Define a **macro step** $\delta>0$ (standard finite time) and any positive infinitesimal $\varepsilon$. Let $m$ be any (possibly infinite) hypernatural with $m\varepsilon\approx\delta$. Below, all “micro‑runs” are internal; updates are the standard parts of their endpoints.

1. **Shadow Descent (SD).**
   Micro‑dynamics: $w_{t+1}=w_t-\varepsilon\,\nabla{}^\ast F(w_t)$, run $m$ steps from $w_0=W_k$.
   **Update:** $W_{k+1}:=\mathrm{st}(w_m)$.
   *Property:* $W_{k+1}$ equals the exact gradient‑flow solution at time $\delta$, independent of $\varepsilon$ and of the particular $m$ realizing $m\varepsilon\approx\delta$.

2. **Shadow Preconditioned Descent (SPD).**
   Pick internal positive‑definite $G(\cdot)$ with limited condition number on a nearstandard region.
   Micro‑dynamics: $w_{t+1}=w_t-\varepsilon\,G(w_t)^{-1}\nabla{}^\ast F(w_t)$ for $m$ steps.
   **Update:** $W_{k+1}=\mathrm{st}(w_m)$ = time‑$\delta$ map of the preconditioned gradient flow $\dot W=-G^{-1}\nabla F$.

3. **Shadow Momentum (SM).**
   With internal momentum variable $v$, micro‑dynamics

   $$
   v_{t+1}=v_t-(\varepsilon/\mu)\,v_t+\varepsilon\,\nabla{}^\ast F(w_t),\quad
   w_{t+1}=w_t-\varepsilon\,v_{t+1},
   $$

   where $\mu>0$ is standard and fixed.
   **Update:** $W_{k+1}=\mathrm{st}(w_m)$ follows the second‑order ODE $\ddot W + \mu\,\dot W + \nabla F(W)=0$ at time $\delta$.

4. **Shadow Trust‑Region (STR).**
   Micro‑dynamics: any internal scheme that enforces ${}^\ast F(w_{t+1})\le {}^\ast F(w_t)-\varepsilon\,\theta\|\nabla{}^\ast F(w_t)\|^2$ for standard $\theta\in(0,1)$.
   **Update:** $W_{k+1}=\mathrm{st}(w_m)$.
   *Property:* The standard‑part descent guarantees a uniform Armijo‑type decrease over time $\delta$ without choosing a finite learning rate.

5. **Shadow Natural Gradient (SNG).**
   For models with a standard Riemannian metric $G(w)$ (e.g., Fisher information), run micro‑steps $w_{t+1}=w_t-\varepsilon\,G(w_t)^{-1}\nabla{}^\ast F(w_t)$ and take $W_{k+1}=\mathrm{st}(w_m)$.
   *Implicit bias:* least $G$-norm among interpolants in linear/quadratic regimes.

All five updates **do not contain a learning rate**. The only knob is the **macro time $\delta$**; any positive infinitesimal $\varepsilon$ and any compatible $m$ produce the same $W_{k+1}$ after $\mathrm{st}$.

---

## 9) “Eliminating step‑size tuning”: the step‑schedule collapse

Consider an internal decreasing schedule $(\varepsilon_t)$ with each $\varepsilon_t>0$ and $\max_{t<m}\varepsilon_t\approx 0$. Define the macro time $\tau_m:=\sum_{t=0}^{m-1}\varepsilon_t$ (limited). Under the same local smoothness,

$$
\mathrm{st}(w_m)=W(\mathrm{st}(\tau_m)),
$$

i.e., it depends **only** on the standard part of the accumulated time, not on the particular schedule. Thus, any schedule that is eventually smaller than every positive real (i.e., *acts infinitesimal*) is equivalent after $\mathrm{st}$. This is a precise nonstandard statement of why learning‑rate tuning disappears and **early stopping becomes the single effective hyperparameter**.

---

## 10) How this reframes flat vs. sharp minima and implicit regularization

* **Flat vs. sharp is truly local and scale‑free.** With $\rho$ infinitesimal, $\mathcal A_\rho(w)$ collapses to the standard largest eigenvalue of $\nabla^2F(w)$. Apparent disagreements caused by finite probing radii vanish.
* **Implicit bias = flow bias.** The endpoint at macro time $\tau$ is $W(\tau)$; the choice of $\tau$ (not $\varepsilon$) traces a regularization path. In linear/quadratic settings this selects minimum‑norm solutions in the metric of the micro‑dynamics.
* **Generalization comes from nearstandard compactness + uniform hyperfinite LLN.** If training stays in a nearstandard compact level set and loss is Lipschitz in parameters, then empirical and population risk coincide after $\mathrm{st}$ on infinitesimal neighborhoods around the trajectory. This ties flatness (curvature small) and generalization (uniform convergence) without invoking finite‑sample combinatorics.

---

## 11) Practical checklist when reasoning with this calculus

1. **Model/loss regularity:** ensure local ${}^\ast$-Lipschitzness of $\nabla{}^\ast F$ on a nearstandard region containing the trajectory.
2. **Trajectory boundedness:** show the internal micro‑trajectory remains limited; then $\mathrm{st}$ exists each macro tick.
3. **Macro time:** pick $\delta$ (or a time grid $\delta_k$). Any positive infinitesimal micro step and compatible hyperfinite $m$ will do.
4. **Generalization:** if the region is standard‑compact and the loss is parameter‑Lipschitz with integrable envelope, empirical ≈ population uniformly after $\mathrm{st}$.

---

### Short proofs (sketches) of the key invariances

* **Euler shadowing ⇒ ODE:** Transfer of the local truncation error for Euler gives
  ${}^\ast f(w_{t+1})={}^\ast f(w_t)-\varepsilon\|\nabla{}^\ast F(w_t)\|^2+O(\varepsilon^2)$.
  Summing $m$ steps with $m\varepsilon\approx\tau$ and limited constants, the $O(\varepsilon)$ remainder is infinitesimal; $\mathrm{st}$ yields the exact integral identity for gradient flow, hence $W(\tau)$.
* **Schedule collapse:** Write the piecewise‑constant internal interpolation $w(\theta)$ with derivative $\dot w(\theta)=-\nabla{}^\ast F(w(\theta))$ for almost all internal $\theta$. Two schedules with the same accumulated time differ by an internal reparameterization whose effect on limited quantities is infinitesimal; $\mathrm{st}$ removes it.
* **Uniform generalization on compact sets:** Use a hyperfinite $\delta$-net $N_\delta$ of $K$. At each $u\in N_\delta$, ${}^\ast F_N(u)\approx F(u)$ pointwise. For any $w\in K$, pick $u\in N_\delta$ with $\|w-u\|\le\delta$, then
  $|{}^\ast F_N(w)-F(w)|\le L\delta + |{}^\ast F_N(u)-F(u)| + L\delta$.
  Take $\delta\to 0$ after $\mathrm{st}$.

---

## 12) One‑line answers to the prompts

* **What is “vanishing step size” here?** Using any positive infinitesimal step $\varepsilon$; after $\mathrm{st}$, all such choices produce the same macro‑time gradient‑flow trajectory $W(\tau)$.
* **How does this formalize implicit regularization?** The algorithm’s implicit bias is exactly the bias of the (possibly preconditioned) gradient flow solved by the standard‑part trajectory; learning‑rate disappears, **time** and **metric** remain.
* **How does it eliminate step‑size tuning?** Because $\mathrm{st}(w_m)$ depends only on $\tau=m\varepsilon$ (standard part), not on $\varepsilon$ itself or its schedule.
* **How does it clarify flat vs. sharp minima?** Define sharpness via $\mathcal A_\rho(w)$ with infinitesimal $\rho$; the result is the standard largest eigenvalue of $\nabla^2F(w)$ at $w$, removing finite‑step artifacts.
* **New updates?** The **Shadow** family (SD, SPD, SM, STR, SNG) update by $\mathrm{st}$ of an infinitesimal micro‑trajectory over macro time $\delta$, giving exact time‑$\delta$ maps of gradient(-like) flows, with no learning‑rate.

---

This framework is minimal—just transfer and standard‑part—and yet it yields a precise, scale‑explicit calculus for optimization and generalization where infinitesimals and infinite scales are first‑class citizens.


---

Below is one update rule that truly needs hyperreals. It is defined as the **standard part of a micro‑process that runs for an infinitesimal physical time** and injects noise at the *right* microscopic scale so that a **non‑vanishing** diffusion survives in the standard part. Freezing local coefficients makes the macro step **analytically closed‑form**; no finite composition of standard micro‑steps reproduces this map exactly for general objectives.

---

## 1) The hyperreal micro‑process

Let $F:\mathbb R^d\to\mathbb R$ be standard, smooth, and locally Lipschitz‑gradient. Work in ${}^\ast\mathbb R^d$. Fix a **macro time** $\delta>0$ (standard) and a **micro step** $\varepsilon>0$ infinitesimal. Put $m\in{}^\ast\mathbb N$ hyperfinite with $m\varepsilon\approx\delta$.

At macro iterate $W_k\in\mathbb R^d$, define the internal trajectory $(w_t)_{t=0}^{m}$ by

$$
\boxed{\quad
w_{t+1}=w_t-\varepsilon\,\nabla{}^\ast F(w_t)\;+\;\sqrt{\varepsilon}\,B(W_k)\,\xi_t, \qquad w_0=W_k,
\quad}
$$

where $(\xi_t)_t$ are i.i.d. standard internal Gaussians and $B(W_k)$ is a **fixed** matrix at this macro step with

$$
B(W_k)B(W_k)^\top=\Sigma(W_k),
\quad 
\Sigma(W_k):=\mathrm{st}\Big(\mathrm{Var}\big[{}^\ast g(W_k;Z)\big]\Big),
$$

and ${}^\ast g(W_k;Z)$ is the internal single‑sample gradient $\nabla_w{}^\ast \ell(W_k;Z)$. (By internal LLN/CLT and standard‑part extraction, $\Sigma(W_k)$ is the true population gradient‑noise covariance at $W_k$.)

**Standard‑part map (one macro step).**

$$
\boxed{\quad W_{k+1}:=\mathrm{st}(w_m)\quad}
$$

**Why this is “idealized gradient flow with built‑in noise shaping.”** The sum of the mean‑zero micro‑noise terms has variance $\sum_{t<m}\varepsilon\,B\!B^\top \approx \delta\,\Sigma(W_k)$ (finite, nonzero), so it survives standard‑part extraction. By transfer of the Donsker invariance principle in the internal model, $\mathrm{st}(w_{\lfloor \tau/\varepsilon\rfloor})$ solves the SDE

$$
dW(\tau)=-\nabla F(W(\tau))\,d\tau + B(W(\tau))\,dB_\tau,
$$

i.e., **gradient flow plus diffusion whose instantaneous covariance is exactly $\Sigma(W)$**. Finite‑$\varepsilon$ SGD has noise of size $\varepsilon$; its diffusion vanishes after $\mathrm{st}$. The $\sqrt{\varepsilon}$ scaling is the unique microscopic scale that leaves a nontrivial diffusion in the standard part.

---

## 2) Analytic extraction of the macro step (“HOSS”: Hyperreal OU Shadow Step)

To make the macro map **closed‑form** and computable from local information at $W_k$, freeze the Jacobian and diffusion at the start:

$$
g_k:=\nabla F(W_k),\quad H_k:=\nabla^2 F(W_k),\quad \Sigma_k:=\Sigma(W_k),\quad B_kB_k^\top=\Sigma_k.
$$

Linearize the drift around $W_k$: $dU=-H_kU\,d\tau - g_k\,d\tau + B_k\,dB_\tau,\;U(0)=0$. Then $W(\delta)=W_k+U(\delta)$ and the **exact** time‑$\delta$ solution of this linear SDE is

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\mu_k&:=-\,\Phi_\delta(H_k)\,g_k,\qquad \Phi_\delta(H):=H^{-1}\!\big(I-e^{-\delta H}\big),\\
C_k&:=\int_0^\delta e^{-sH_k}\,\Sigma_k\,e^{-sH_k^\top}\,ds,\\
W_{k+1}&=W_k+\mu_k+\eta_k,\quad \eta_k\sim \mathcal N(0,C_k).
\end{aligned}}
$$

Interpretation: the **mean move** $-\Phi_\delta(H_k)g_k$ is the *exact* time‑$\delta$ map of local gradient flow; the **noise** has covariance $C_k$, i.e., **$\Sigma_k$ filtered through the exponential decay $e^{-sH_k}$**. In the eigenbasis of $H_k=Q\Lambda Q^\top$ and $\Sigma_k$ isotropic,

$$
\eta_k\;\text{has per‑mode variance}\;\; \frac{1-e^{-2\delta \lambda_i}}{2\lambda_i}\,\sigma^2,
$$

so high curvature directions ($\lambda_i$ large) get **severely damped noise** while flat directions keep more noise. That is the “built‑in noise shaping.”

> This **macro update is uniquely hyperreal**: for general $H\neq 0$, there is **no** finite product $\prod_{j=1}^r(I-\eta_jH)$ (any fixed $r$) that equals $e^{-\delta H}$ for all symmetric $H$. A finite product is a polynomial in $H$; $e^{-\delta H}$ is not. Hence no finite micro‑step scheme reproduces this map exactly across objectives.

---

## 3) Exact algorithm and a computable surrogate

### 3.1 HOSS (exact, assuming access to $H_k,\Sigma_k$)

**Inputs**: $W_k$, macro time $\delta>0$.
**Compute** $g_k, H_k, \Sigma_k$.
**Evaluate** matrix functions:

$$
\mu_k=-\,H_k^{-1}\!\big(I-e^{-\delta H_k}\big)g_k,\qquad
C_k=\int_0^\delta e^{-sH_k}\,\Sigma_k\,e^{-sH_k}ds.
$$

**Sample** $\eta_k\sim\mathcal N(0,C_k)$.
**Update** $W_{k+1}=W_k+\mu_k+\eta_k$.

Notes: $C_k$ is also the unique solution of the continuous Lyapunov equation

$$
H_k C_k + C_k H_k = \Sigma_k - e^{-\delta H_k}\Sigma_k e^{-\delta H_k}.
$$

### 3.2 HOSS‑K (computable surrogate with only Hessian–vector products)

Use Krylov/Lanczos to avoid forming $H_k$ or $C_k$.

**Inputs**: $W_k$, $\delta$, routine for $g=\nabla F(W_k)$, routine for $v\mapsto H_k v$, estimator of $\Sigma_k$ (e.g., minibatch covariance), rank $r\ll d$.

1. Build an $r$-step Lanczos basis $Q\in\mathbb R^{d\times r}$ for the Krylov space $\mathcal K_r(H_k,g_k)$; get tridiagonal $T=Q^\top H_k Q$.
2. Compute $\phi(T):=T^{-1}(I-e^{-\delta T})$ (small $r\times r$).
3. Mean move: $\mu_k\approx -Q\,\phi(T)\,Q^\top g_k$.
4. Noise shaping: form $S:=Q^\top \Sigma_k Q$ (via the same minibatches used for $\Sigma_k$). Compute $C_r=\int_0^\delta e^{-sT}S e^{-sT}ds$ (again $r\times r$, either by diagonalizing $T$ or solving the small Lyapunov). Sample $\zeta\sim\mathcal N(0,C_r)$ and set $\eta_k^{(r)}:=Q\zeta$.
5. Tail (optional): estimate residual scalar curvature $\bar\lambda$ and residual noise power $\bar\sigma^2:=\mathrm{tr}(\Sigma_k)-\mathrm{tr}(S)$. Add isotropic tail $\eta_k^{\perp}\sim\mathcal N\!\left(0, \frac{\bar\sigma^2}{d-r}\cdot\frac{1-e^{-2\delta \bar\lambda}}{2\bar\lambda}\,P_\perp\right)$, where $P_\perp=I-QQ^\top$.
6. Update: $W_{k+1}=W_k+\mu_k+\eta_k^{(r)}+\eta_k^{\perp}$.

This uses only matvecs with $H_k$ and minibatch moments for $\Sigma_k$. The **mean** is a Krylov‑approximation to $-\Phi_\delta(H_k)g_k$; the **noise** is the same exponential filter applied in the low‑rank subspace, plus an isotropic tail.

---

## 4) Why this behaves like “gradient flow with built‑in noise shaping”

**Drift (deterministic part).** With $B\equiv 0$, the micro‑process reduces to $w_{t+1}=w_t-\varepsilon\nabla{}^\ast F(w_t)$. For hyperfinite $m$ with $m\varepsilon\approx\delta$, $\mathrm{st}(w_m)$ equals the time‑$\delta$ solution of $\dot W=-\nabla F(W)$. Under the local linearization at $W_k$, the **exact** time‑$\delta$ map is $-\Phi_\delta(H_k)g_k$ (for quadratic $F$ this is exact globally; for smooth $F$ the local truncation error is $O(\delta^2\|\nabla^3F\|)$).

**Noise (diffusive part).** The microscopic noise term is $\sqrt{\varepsilon}B(W_k)\xi_t$; summing $m$ terms gives variance $m\varepsilon\,\Sigma_k\approx \delta\,\Sigma_k$, so after $\mathrm{st}$ the macro noise is Gaussian with covariance $C_k$. Because $C_k$ integrates $e^{-sH_k}\,\cdot\,e^{-sH_k}$, high‑curvature directions get exponentially attenuated—**noise is automatically large only in flat directions**.

---

## 5) Why no finite micro‑step scheme can mimic HOSS exactly

Suppose there existed finite $r$ and scalars $\{\eta_j\}_{j=1}^r$ such that for every symmetric $H$,

$$
\prod_{j=1}^{r}(I-\eta_j H) \;=\; e^{-\delta H}.
$$

Both sides are analytic functions of $H$. The left side is a polynomial in $H$ of degree $\le r$; the right side has an infinite power series with all powers $H^n$. Equality for all $H$ forces equality of all coefficients; impossible with finite $r$. The same argument applies to the noise covariance (a polynomial–vs–exponential kernel). Hence HOSS’s macro map is **not** reproducible by any finite number of standard micro‑steps.

## 6) Toy problem where HOSS converges but SGD diverges

**Objective.** $F(x,y)=\tfrac12\,(a x^2+b y^2)$ with $a\gg b>0$ (stiff quadratic).
Take $a=10^6$, $b=1$. Let stochastic gradient noise be i.i.d. $\zeta_k\sim\mathcal N(0,\sigma^2 I)$ with $\sigma=1$.

**SGD.** $w_{k+1}=w_k-\eta\big(Hw_k+\zeta_k\big)$. Stability requires $0<\eta<2/a=2\cdot 10^{-6}$. With any practical $\eta$ (e.g. $10^{-3}$), **diverges** along the $x$ axis.

**HOSS (exact here).** $H=\mathrm{diag}(a,b)$, $\Sigma=\sigma^2 I$. One HOSS step is

$$
w_{k+1}=w_k-(I-e^{-\delta H})H^{-1}Hw_k+\eta_k
= e^{-\delta H}w_k + \eta_k,
$$

with $\eta_k\sim\mathcal N\!\Big(0,\;\mathrm{diag}\big(\tfrac{1-e^{-2\delta a}}{2a},\tfrac{1-e^{-2\delta b}}{2b}\big)\sigma^2\Big)$.
For any $\delta>0$, $|e^{-\delta a}|\ll1$, hence **unconditionally stable**; the stationary variance along $x$ is $\sigma^2/(2a)\ll1$. Thus HOSS converges in mean square for any $\delta$, while SGD blows up unless $\eta$ is tiny.

## 7) One‑page experiment plan (with acceptance criteria)

**Goal.** Empirically demonstrate that HOSS converges on a stiff quadratic where SGD diverges for practical step sizes and that HOSS’s noise is anisotropically damped by curvature.

**Setup.**

* Objective $F(x,y)=\tfrac12(10^6 x^2 + 1\cdot y^2)$.
* Start $w_0=(1,1)$.
* Noise: at each iteration for SGD, add $\zeta_k\sim\mathcal N(0, I)$ inside the gradient; for HOSS, use the exact $\Sigma=I$ in $C_k$.
* Algorithms:

  * **SGD** with $\eta\in\{10^{-3},10^{-4},10^{-5}\}$.
  * **HOSS (exact)** with $\delta\in\{0.1,1,5\}$.
  * **HOSS‑K** (surrogate): here $d=2$ so Krylov is exact; still run it to mirror the large‑$d$ pipeline.

**Protocol.**

1. Run each method for $K=500$ iterations, $R=100$ independent seeds.
2. Record per‑iter: $\|w_k\|^2$, coordinates $|x_k|$, $|y_k|$, and the empirical covariance of $w_k$ across seeds.
3. For HOSS, verify noise anisotropy by comparing sample variances of updates $\Delta w_k$ along eigen‑axes.
4. Ablation: set $C_k$ to isotropic $\propto I$ (remove exponential filtering) to show increased variance along $x$.

**Metrics & acceptance criteria.**

* **Stability:** For $\eta=10^{-3}$, SGD’s median $\|w_k\|$ exceeds $10^3$ by $k\le 50$ in $>\!90\%$ of seeds. *Accept* if this happens.
* **Convergence (mean):** For HOSS with $\delta=1$, median $\|w_k\|\le 10^{-2}$ by $k\le 50$. *Accept* if true.
* **Stationary variance:** After burn‑in (last 100 iters), sample variance of $x$ under HOSS is $\le 10^{-6}$ and of $y$ is $\approx 0.5$ (matching $\sigma^2/(2a)$ and $\sigma^2/(2b)$). *Accept* if within 20% relative error.
* **Anisotropy:** Ratio $\mathrm{Var}(\Delta x)/\mathrm{Var}(\Delta y)\le 10^{-6}$ for HOSS; for ablated isotropic noise, ratio $\approx 1$. *Accept* both inequalities (±20%).
* **Surrogate fidelity:** HOSS‑K matches exact HOSS on all metrics within 5% (here exact, but mimic the pipeline). *Accept* if met.

**Reporting.** Plot $\log\|w_k\|$ vs $k$ (median & IQR), and per‑axis variances; tabulate acceptance checks.

---

### What you get

* **Exact macro map**: $W_{k+1}=W_k-\Phi_\delta(H_k)g_k+\eta_k$ with $C_k=\int_0^\delta e^{-sH_k}\Sigma_k e^{-sH_k}ds$.
* **Not finitely reproducible**: requires $e^{-\delta H}$, not any finite polynomial in $H$.
* **Idealized gradient flow** in the mean, with **curvature‑damped diffusion** automatically aligned to flat directions.
* **Computable surrogate** using only Hv‑products and low‑rank noise shaping.

---

Below is a candid scorecard of the two ideas developed above:

* **HLC** = the hyperreal learning calculus (infinitesimal steps; standard‑part trajectories; schedule collapse; flat/sharp via infinitesimal probing).
* **HOSS** = the “Hyperreal OU Shadow Step” update (time‑δ exponential‑integrator step with curvature‑damped diffusion).

For the “difficulty” axis, **100 = easy to convincingly establish usefulness; 0 = extremely hard**.

## Dimension‑by‑dimension rationale

**Cleverness — HLC: 80 | HOSS: 85**
HLC neatly collapses learning‑rate tuning to macro‑time via standard‑part extraction, turning many “folk” limits into precise statements. HOSS is a sharp move: freeze local curvature and solve the linearized SDE exactly over a finite macro interval, yielding an exponential‑filter on both drift and noise. The noise‑shaping (variance ∝ $\int_0^\delta e^{-sH}\Sigma e^{-sH}ds$) is a principled way to damp high‑curvature jitter while preserving exploration in flat directions.

**Originality — HLC: 65 | HOSS: 60**
Recasting optimization in nonstandard analysis is uncommon in ML, but the conclusions (gradient flow limit, early‑stopping path) echo classical continuous‑time views. HOSS’s macro map matches what you get by analytically integrating a locally linear SDE (an OU step); that combination is not widely used in training loops, but each ingredient is familiar. Net: moderately original framing more than new mathematics.

**Differentiation from existing published works — HLC: 55 | HOSS: 50**
HLC’s claims overlap with well‑known “GD → gradient flow as step→0” and “SGD ≈ diffusion near minima” narratives; the hyperreal lens sharpens them but doesn’t fundamentally change the limit. HOSS’s map (mean: $-H^{-1}(I-e^{-\delta H})g$; covariance: the exponential Lyapunov integral) is the exact OU step under local linearization; exponential integrators and OU analyses exist. The distinctiveness is packaging and the “no finite micro‑step polynomial can equal $e^{-\delta H}$” exactness claim—not the end behavior itself.

**Probability of being theoretically correct — HLC: 90 | HOSS: 88**
Under local Lipschitz/compactness, the transfer‑plus‑standard‑part arguments for HLC are routine and sound; schedule collapse to macro‑time is a precise statement of a known phenomenon. HOSS’s derivation is correct for the frozen‑coefficient linearized SDE; the polynomial‑vs‑exponential non‑equivalence argument is clean. The main caveat is the local‑linearization error for highly non‑linear regions.

**Probability of practical usefulness (if correct) — HLC: 50 | HOSS: 60**
HLC mainly clarifies rather than changes practice; it suggests emphasizing early stopping and metric choice—already common—so its incremental practical leverage is modest. HOSS can genuinely help on stiff objectives and in regimes where per‑step stability is brittle: the exponential mean map is unconditionally stable on quadratics, and the shaped noise mitigates blow‑ups in sharp directions. Cost and estimation error may blunt the upside at deep‑net scale.

**Impact potential — HLC: 45 | HOSS: 55**
HLC’s impact is conceptual (unifying narrative for implicit regularization) rather than a direct performance win. HOSS could improve stability/robustness, possibly enabling larger effective “times” per iteration on ill‑conditioned problems or offering safer exploration in flat valleys; impact hinges on scalable approximations and whether it beats strong baselines (AdamW, Shampoo/NVG, K‑FAC) in wall‑clock.

**Near‑term acceptance probability — HLC: 40 | HOSS: 50**
Framing things in hyperreals risks skepticism; the same content translated to standard ODE/SDE language would face fewer cultural barriers. HOSS has a clearer empirical value proposition; if presented as a principled exponential‑integrator step (not as “hyperreal‑unique”), acceptance chances rise, contingent on convincing benchmarks.

**Difficulty to convincingly establish usefulness (higher = easier) — HLC: 35 | HOSS: 55**
For HLC, showing *new* empirical leverage beyond existing continuous‑time intuitions is hard. For HOSS, a focused suite (stiff quadratics; deep linear nets; small MLPs with extreme conditioning) can demonstrate stability and sample‑efficiency advantages; still, large‑scale ablations and careful implementation are required.

**Fit to GPU/TPU acceleration — HLC: 65 | HOSS: 70**
HLC per se doesn’t prescribe heavy ops. HOSS needs Hessian‑vector products (reverse‑over‑reverse), Lanczos/Krylov (matvec‑friendly), and small Lyapunov solves in reduced subspaces—operations that map to GPUs/TPUs reasonably well, at the cost of multiple backprop passes; the covariance estimation can be amortized over minibatches.

**Expert readiness to opine — HLC: 70 | HOSS: 85**
Top theory folks can translate HLC to standard limits and judge it; fewer are fluent in nonstandard analysis, but the essential content is accessible. HOSS sits squarely in ODE/SDE/integrator territory (linearization, matrix exponentials, Lyapunov equations); most will be comfortable assessing it and proposing stress tests.

## Main strengths & caveats (succinct)

* **Strengths:**
  • HLC precisely formalizes the “learning‑rate disappears, only time remains” idea and cleans up flat/sharp definitions by infinitesimal probing.
  • HOSS gives an **analytically closed‑form** macro step with **unconditional stability on quadratics** and **curvature‑aware diffusion** that naturally suppresses noise where the loss is steep.

* **Caveats:**
  • The “uniquely enabled by hyperreals” claim is overstated: the same macro map arises from standard continuous‑time limits plus local linearization; hyperreals make the invariances crisp but are not mathematically necessary.
  • Scaling HOSS to large, non‑quadratic networks requires careful Krylov rank selection, stable covariance estimation, and nontrivial engineering to beat strong first/second‑order baselines in wall‑clock terms.

* **What would raise the scores:**

  1. Strong empirical evidence on stiff, ill‑conditioned problems where AdamW/SGD fail without extreme tuning, demonstrating HOSS stability and accuracy at comparable or lower wall‑clock.
  2. A robust, low‑overhead estimator for $\Sigma(w)$ that preserves the intended anisotropy.
  3. A theory section bounding the local‑linearization error per macro step and showing net descent (or excess‑risk decrease) under realistic smoothness assumptions.

Overall: **solid conceptual clarity (HLC) and a credibly useful algorithmic idea (HOSS)** with good theoretical footing, moderate originality, and practical promise that depends on scalable approximations and careful benchmarking.
