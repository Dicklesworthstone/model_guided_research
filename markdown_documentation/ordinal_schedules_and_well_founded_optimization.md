Below is a clean, self‑contained way to model training as an ordinal‑indexed process that makes progress by descent in a well‑founded ranking. I’ll set up the objects, state the descent/plateau rules, prove progress by transfinite induction, and then show how phases, resets, curriculum, early stopping, annealing, and restarts fall out as ordinal jumps.

---

## 1) Setup: training as a transfinite trace

* Let $X$ be the space of training states (parameters, buffers, optimizer state, etc.).
* Fix an ordinal horizon $\Lambda$ and define a **training trace** $s:\alpha\mapsto s_\alpha\in X$ for all $\alpha\le \Lambda$ by transfinite recursion:

  * **Successor step:** $s_{\alpha+1} = F_\alpha(s_\alpha)$.
  * **Limit step:** for limit $\lambda$, $s_\lambda = \mathsf{Consol}_\lambda\big((s_\beta)_{\beta<\lambda}\big)$.

Only the logic of well‑ordering is assumed; no topology, metrics, or continuity are required.

---

## 2) The ranking function and the descent contract

* A **ranking** is a function $\rho:X\to \mathbf{Ord}$ into the ordinals.
* The training rules commit to the following **descent contract**:

  **(D1) Monotone successors.** For every successor step, $\rho(s_{\alpha+1})\le \rho(s_\alpha)$.

  **(D2) Plateau drop at limits.** If for some limit $\lambda$ the tail is eventually constant in rank—i.e. there exists $c$ and $\beta_0<\lambda$ with $\rho(s_\beta)=c$ for all $\beta\in[\beta_0,\lambda)$—then the consolidation is **rank‑reducing**:

  $$
  \rho(s_\lambda) < c.
  $$

Intuition: successors do not increase the rank; if they stall at the same rank along a cofinal tail to $\lambda$, the limit step must strictly drop it.

This is the only place we use anything beyond monotonicity: limits are the mechanism that force a strict decrease after a genuine plateau.

---

## 3) Phases, resets, curriculum as ordinal structure

A convenient way to realize $\rho$ is a **finite ordinal polynomial** (Cantor normal form):

$$
\rho(x)=\omega^{e_k} a_k(x)+\cdots+\omega^{e_1} a_1(x)+a_0(x),
$$

with $e_k>\cdots>e_1\ge 1$ and $a_i(x)\in\mathbb{N}$. Interpretations:

* The **principal exponent** $e_k$ marks the **phase level**.
* The coefficient $a_k$ counts how many phase‑level units remain.
* Lower terms $\omega^{e_{k-1}}a_{k-1}+\cdots+a_0$ are **intra‑phase budgets** (curriculum items, temperature levels, inner steps).

Because ordinal order is lexicographic by exponents, any drop in a higher term dominates any increase (reset) of all lower terms.

* **Phase:** the maximal ordinal interval on which the principal term $\omega^{e_k}a_k$ is unchanged. Within a phase you are allowed to spend lower‑order budgets.
* **Reset:** a change that decreases some higher‑order coefficient (e.g., $a_j\mapsto a_j-1$ for $j\ge 1$) while possibly re‑inflating all lower terms. Ordinally this is still a strict decrease.
* **Curriculum:** moving from curriculum item $u$ to $u+1$ is encoded as decreasing a mid‑level coefficient while re‑initializing lower‑level counters. Again this is a strict ordinal drop.

A simple, expressive instance is

$$
\rho = \omega^2 A + \omega B + C,
$$

with $A=$ architecture/structure budget (few changes), $B=$ curriculum/temperature budget, and $C=$ inner‑loop budget. Successor steps reduce $C$ when they truly improve; plateaus at fixed $C$ trigger limit‑stage reductions of $B$; exhausting $B$ triggers rarer phase changes by reducing $A$.

---

## 4) Plateaus and limit‑stage consolidation

Define a **plateau at $c$** on $[\mu,\lambda)$ (with $\lambda$ limit) by $\rho(s_\beta)=c$ for all $\beta\in[\mu,\lambda)$. The **consolidation operator** $\mathsf{Consol}_\lambda$ is specified so that:

* It **respects eventual properties**: if a property $P$ holds for all sufficiently large $\beta<\lambda$, then $P$ holds at $s_\lambda$.
* Under a plateau, it **reduces rank** per (D2): $\rho(s_\lambda)<c$.

Conceptually, $\mathsf{Consol}$ passes to a “normal form” capturing the invariants stabilized on the plateau and burns one unit of a higher‑order budget to break the stalemate. Ordinally, that is exactly a jump from $c$ to some $c'<c$.

---

## 5) Progress guarantee (no infinite dithering)

**Theorem (Progress by ordinal descent).** Under (D1)–(D2), the set

$$
D \;=\; \{\alpha\le \Lambda:\rho(s_\alpha)<\rho(s_\beta)\text{ for all }\beta<\alpha\}
$$

of strict‑descent indices is well‑ordered and finite in the sense that its order type is $< \rho(s_0)+1$. In particular, there is no infinite sequence of strict decreases, and every genuine plateau is followed by a strict decrease at its limit.

*Proof sketch.* By well‑foundedness of the ordinals, there is no infinite strictly descending sequence of ranks. Successor steps can only lower or keep the rank. If they keep it along a cofinal tail to $\lambda$, (D2) forces a strict drop at $\lambda$. Thus strict drops occur only well‑foundedly many times, each bounded by $\rho(s_0)$. ∎

Corollaries:

* **Termination under full descent:** If $\rho$ is bounded below and the process cannot continue without strict descent (e.g., budgets eventually exhaust), then the trace reaches a minimal rank in finitely many strict drops.
* **Finiteness of high‑level changes:** In a CNF ranking, each coefficient $a_j\in\mathbb{N}$ can decrease only finitely many times. So there are only finitely many phase changes, finitely many curriculum escalations, etc., each bounded by the initial coefficient values.

---

## 6) How the ordinal view reframes the usual knobs

### Early stopping

Early stopping becomes a **stopping rule on the ordinal** rather than on a real‑valued metric. Choose a cutoff $\theta\in\mathbf{Ord}$ and halt at the first $\alpha$ with $\rho(s_\alpha)\le \theta$. Because $\rho$ is well‑founded and nonincreasing, this rule is coherent and cannot be “one step short of a big improvement” in the ordinal sense: any further improvement must spend a higher‑order budget and hence strictly lower $\rho$ below $\theta$. Thus early stopping is: *do not consume the next high‑order unit*.

Operationally: stop at the **first limit point** $\lambda$ where consolidation would burn the next $\omega^k$-budget you have decided not to spend. This cleanly separates *micro‑fit* (lower terms) from *macro‑complexity* (higher terms).

### Annealing

Annealing becomes an **ordinal schedule of budget drops**. For instance, temperature level is the coefficient $B$ in $\rho=\omega^2A+\omega B+C$. A cooling step is an ordinal jump $\omega B \mapsto \omega(B-1) + C'$, which strictly lowers $\rho$ regardless of the $C'$ reset. Deterministic schedules (cool every $\omega$ inner steps) or adaptive schedules (cool only at plateau limits) are both special cases of choosing when to trigger the $\omega$-term decrement. The well‑foundedness ensures you cannot cool forever without making structural progress: each cooling burns one unit of $B$.

### Restarts

Restarts are **not regressions** but **higher‑order decrements with lower‑order resets**. A restart reduces a mid‑ or high‑level coefficient (say $B\mapsto B-1$ or $A\mapsto A-1$) and may freely re‑inflate all lower counters $C\mapsto C'$. Ordinally,

$$
\omega^2A+\omega(B-1)+C' \;<\; \omega^2A+\omega B+C,
$$

so a restart is intrinsically progress in $\rho$. This reframes “try a fresh seed/optimizer” as *consuming* meta‑budget rather than cycling aimlessly; you are guaranteed not to invoke restarts indefinitely.

---

## 7) Concrete design pattern for $\rho$ and rules

A robust, minimal template that captures phases, curriculum, and micro‑optimization:

* Pick $A_0,B_0,C_0\in\mathbb{N}$ and define $\rho=\omega^2A+\omega B+C$.
* **Within-phase steps (successors):** attempt changes that (when successful) reduce $C$. Enforce (D1); if many attempts fail, nothing forbids $C$ from staying constant.
* **Plateau detection:** if $\rho$ is constant on a cofinal tail below some $\lambda$, declare a plateau.
* **Limit consolidation at $\lambda$:**

  * If plateau with constant $\rho=\omega^2A+\omega B+C$ is detected, set

    $$
    s_\lambda=\mathsf{Consol}( (s_\beta)_{\beta<\lambda})\quad\text{with}\quad \rho(s_\lambda)=\omega^2A+\omega(B-1)+C'.
    $$

    This is the **anneal/curriculum step**. Choose any $C'\in\mathbb{N}$; ordinally it does not undo the drop.
  * If $B=0$ and plateau persists, consolidate by decreasing $A$:

    $$
    \rho(s_\lambda)=\omega^2(A-1)+\omega B'+C' .
    $$
* This implements: many micro steps per temperature level; finitely many temperatures per architecture; finitely many architectures overall—because each is a finite coefficient.

Everything above is just the ordinal order: we never used real numbers, only the well‑foundedness of $\mathbf{Ord}$.

---

## 8) Why this guarantees “progress”

* **No infinite dithering at one rank:** If successors fail to reduce $\rho$ along a cofinal tail, the next limit step must reduce it by (D2).
* **No infinite regress across levels:** Each mid/high‑level jump decrements a finite coefficient in CNF, so only finitely many such jumps exist.
* **Total strict decreases bounded:** The number of strict drops in $\rho$ is $<\rho(s_0)+1$; thus the descent cannot stall without either achieving a new lower rank or exhausting the ordinal budget.

“Progress,” in this framing, is not “loss goes down,” but “the **well‑founded potential** $\rho$ goes down.” Plateaus are not pathologies but **evidence** that all remaining micro‑improvements at the current level have been spent; the limit‑stage consolidation is the formally sanctioned way to convert that evidence into a higher‑order decrement.

---

## 9) Summary mapping of common heuristics

* **Phases:** maximal ranges where the principal exponent of $\rho$ is fixed; micro‑work happens on lower terms.
* **Resets:** strict ordinal drops in a higher term with arbitrary re‑initialization of lower terms.
* **Curriculum:** a planned sequence of higher‑order decrements (e.g., $B\mapsto B-1$) that only occur after plateaus at the current level.
* **Early stopping:** halt at the first $\alpha$ with $\rho(s_\alpha)\le \theta$ for a chosen ordinal threshold $\theta$, i.e., *do not spend the next unit of higher‑order budget*.
* **Annealing:** the deterministic or adaptive policy for when to perform the $\omega$-term decrements; every such cooldown is a guaranteed ordinal drop.
* **Restarts:** deliberately consume a meta‑budget unit (drop a higher coefficient) to escape micro‑level stagnation; progress is certified because the ordinal strictly decreases.

This is “just” the logic of well‑ordering and transfinite induction: (i) pick a ranking into ordinals, (ii) never increase it at successors, (iii) force a strict drop at the limit of any cofinal plateau. Everything else—phases, resets, curriculum, early stopping, annealing, and restarts—becomes a particular way of spending finite coefficients in the Cantor normal form of $\rho$.

Below is one concrete, *provably decreasing* ordinal scheduler. It maps wall‑clock steps to a small ordinal, enforces monotone descent in a ranking, and prescribes exactly what to do at successor and limit stages. Then I give compact pseudocode, a minimal hyperparameter set, and a test plan with crisp pass/fail.

---

## 1) Ranking and ordinal mapping

Let the scheduler maintain a triple $(A,B,C)\in\mathbb{N}^3$ and define the **ranking**

$$
\rho(A,B,C)=\omega^2 A+\omega B+C\quad(<\varepsilon_0).
$$

Intuition: $A$ = restart budget (phase level), $B$ = anneal/curriculum budget within the phase, $C$ = patience (inner budget) to detect a plateau at the current $B$.

* **Successor step (ordinary training step):** either $C$ stays the same (if we observe improvement) or decreases by $1$ (if no improvement). This preserves $\rho$ or decreases it.
* **Limit step (plateau consolidation):** when $C$ hits $0$, we strictly drop a higher term and reset lower terms:

  * If $B>0$: set $(A,B,C)\leftarrow(A,B-1,\;P(B-1))$.
  * Else (so $B=0$ and $C=0$): if $A>0$, set $(A,B,C)\leftarrow(A-1,\;B_{\text{init}},\;P(B_{\text{init}}))$.
    In both cases $\rho$ strictly decreases because a higher‑order coefficient drops, and ordinal lexicographic order ignores any re‑inflation of lower terms.

**Monotonicity guarantee (sketch):**

* Successors: $C$ never increases, so $\rho$ never increases.
* Limits: $\omega^2 A+\omega B+0>\omega^2 A+\omega(B-1)+C'$ and $\omega^2 A+0+0>\omega^2(A-1)+\omega B'+C'$ for any finite $B',C'$.
  Thus the schedule is *provably* nonincreasing at successors and *strictly* decreasing at limits. No schedule that violates this proof is admissible.

**Wall‑clock → ordinal mapping.** At wall‑clock step $t$, define

$$
\alpha(t)=\omega^2\bigl(A_0-A(t)\bigr)+\omega\bigl(B_{\text{init}}-B(t)\bigr)+\bigl(P(B(t))-C(t)\bigr),
$$

so $\alpha$ increases only when we consume budget; it is always $<\omega^3\ll\varepsilon_0$.

---

## 2) What changes at successor vs. limit stages

Let $\eta$ be the learning rate. The scheduler prescribes:

* **Successor step (no plateau):**

  * If the *smoothed* validation loss improves: keep $C$ unchanged; keep hyperparameters unchanged. (No rank increase; $\rho$ stays the same.)
  * If not: decrement $C\leftarrow C-1$. (This strictly reduces $\rho$ by 1.)

* **Limit step (plateau consolidation when $C=0$):**

  * **Anneal** one level: $B\leftarrow B-1$ if $B>0$; multiply LR by $\gamma\in(0,1)$: $\eta\leftarrow \gamma\eta$; reset $C\leftarrow P(B)$.
  * **Restart** when a phase exhausts: if $B=0$ and $C=0$, then $A\leftarrow A-1$; **reset optimizer state** (e.g., zero Adam moments), **reset LR upward** to $\eta\leftarrow \eta_0$ (this does not affect $\rho$); reset $B\leftarrow B_{\text{init}}$; reset $C\leftarrow P(B_{\text{init}})$.

This realizes “successors do micro work; limits force a strictly lower ordinal” while allowing LR to rise on restart without breaking the descent proof (LR is not part of $\rho$).

---

## 3) Minimal hyperparameter set

* $\eta_0>0$: initial learning rate.
* $\gamma\in(0,1)$: LR decay multiplier applied at each limit (anneal) and optional floor after restart is $\eta_0$.
* $A_0\in\mathbb{N}$: restart budget (phases).
* $B_{\text{init}}\in\mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}$: anneal/curriculum levels per phase.
* $P_0\in\mathbb{N}_{\ge 1}$: base patience.

**Derived (no extra knobs):**

* Patience schedule $P(B)=P_0\cdot 2^{(B_{\text{init}}-B)}$ (longer patience as you cool).
* Improvement test uses an exponential moving average (EMA) of validation loss with decay $\beta=0.9$ (fixed, not a hyperparameter) and a **strict** improvement criterion $\bar{L}_t < L^*$ (no tolerance parameter).

## 4) Pseudocode (scheduler only; drop‑in to any training loop)

```text
state:
  A := A0
  B := B_init
  C := P(B)
  eta := eta0
  L_best := +inf
  L_ema := +inf
  consolidations := 0  # optional counter

function scheduler_step(observed_val_loss):
  # update smoothed metric (fixed beta=0.9)
  L_ema := 0.9 * L_ema + 0.1 * observed_val_loss

  improved := (L_ema < L_best)
  if improved:
    L_best := L_ema
    # successor with no ordinal change
    return {lr: eta, action: "successor"}
  else:
    # successor with ordinal decrease in C
    if C > 0:
      C := C - 1
      return {lr: eta, action: "successor(C-1)"}
    else:
      # limit-stage consolidation (plateau)
      if B > 0:
        B := B - 1                 # strict ordinal drop at ω-term
        eta := gamma * eta         # anneal LR
        C := P(B)                  # reset patience for new level
        L_best := +inf             # re-open improvement window
        consolidations := consolidations + 1
        return {lr: eta, action: "limit:anneal"}
      else:
        if A > 0:
          A := A - 1               # strict ordinal drop at ω^2-term
          B := B_init              # reset anneal ladder
          eta := eta0              # restart LR upward
          C := P(B)                # reset patience
          reset_optimizer_state()  # zero moments, reshuffle order/seed
          L_best := +inf
          consolidations := consolidations + 1
          return {lr: eta, action: "limit:restart"}
        else:
          # no budgets left; keep training at current eta
          return {lr: eta, action: "exhausted"}
```

**Correctness (ordinal descent):**

* On every non-improving successor, $C\mapsto C-1\Rightarrow \rho$ decreases by 1.
* On improving successors, $\rho$ is unchanged.
* On limit steps, either $B\mapsto B-1$ or $A\mapsto A-1$, which strictly decreases $\rho$ regardless of any resets to $C$ or LR. Hence $\rho$ is nonincreasing at successors and strictly decreases at limits. QED.

---

## 5) Why this helps on noisy/nonstationary objectives

* Noise induces spurious small “improvements.” Because improvements *do not* reset $C$, they merely pause its countdown; genuine progress delays consolidation, but random noise cannot increase $\rho$ or cause premature anneal.
* When progress truly stalls, the limit step fires automatically (after $P(B)$ non‑improving steps), consuming a higher‑order unit and reducing LR—guaranteed ordinal progress.
* If the data distribution or optimum shifts late, the **restart** both strictly lowers $\rho$ (via $A\mapsto A-1$) and **raises** LR back to $\eta_0$, restoring plasticity without violating descent because LR is not in the ranking.

---

## 6) Test plan (noisy objective where cosine/linear underperform)

**Task:** Streaming linear regression with abrupt shifts and heavy‑tailed noise.

* Dimension $d=50$. At step $t$, draw $x_t\sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$.
* Ground truth is piecewise constant: $\theta^*(t)=\theta^{(1)}$ for $t<0.4T$, $\theta^{(2)}$ for $0.4T\le t<0.7T$, $\theta^{(3)}$ for $t\ge 0.7T$. Each $\theta^{(k)}$ is sampled once per run with $\|\theta^{(k)}\|_2=1$.
* Observations: $y_t = x_t^\top \theta^*(t) + \xi_t$ with $\xi_t \sim \text{Student-}t(\nu=3)$ (heavy‑tailed).
* Train a linear model $\hat{\theta}$ with SGD + momentum 0.9; batch size 1; objective is squared error.
* Validation loss $L_t$ is an EMA of instantaneous squared error on a held‑out stream drawn from the *current* segment’s distribution.

**Budgets and knobs (fixed across all methods):**

* Total steps $T=200{,}000$.
* Baseline LR schedules:

  * **Cosine:** $\eta(t)=\eta_0 \cdot \tfrac12(1+\cos(\pi t/T))$.
  * **Linear:** $\eta(t)=\eta_0\cdot(1-t/T)$.
* **Ordinal scheduler (proposed):** use the minimal hyperparameters:

  * $\eta_0=0.1,\ \gamma=0.5,\ A_0=2,\ B_{\text{init}}=3,\ P_0=1200$.
  * $P(B)=P_0\cdot 2^{(B_{\text{init}}-B)}$ → patience ladder $1200,2400,4800$.

**What will happen (reasoning):**
Cosine/linear inevitably shrink LR early, so after the shifts at $0.4T$ and $0.7T$ they adapt slowly. The ordinal scheduler preserves LR during genuine improvement bursts and only decays after a proven plateau; after the late shift it **restarts** to $\eta_0$, regaining fast adaptation while still strictly descending in the ranking.

**Evaluation metric:** final test MSE averaged over the last $0.05T$ steps of each segment (so the last window uses segment 3), computed on a fresh stream.

**Replications:** 20 random seeds for $\theta^{(k)}$ and the noise.

**Crisp pass/fail criteria (after fixed compute $T$):**

* Let $\text{MSE}_{\text{ord},i}$, $\text{MSE}_{\text{cos},i}$, $\text{MSE}_{\text{lin},i}$ be run‑$i$ final MSEs.
* **Pass** if both hold:

  1. Median improvement: $\operatorname{median}_i \text{MSE}_{\text{ord},i} \le 0.95 \cdot \min\{\operatorname{median}_i \text{MSE}_{\text{cos},i},\ \operatorname{median}_i \text{MSE}_{\text{lin},i}\}$.
  2. Per‑run dominance: at least 16/20 runs satisfy $\text{MSE}_{\text{ord},i} \le 0.95 \cdot \min\{\text{MSE}_{\text{cos},i},\ \text{MSE}_{\text{lin},i}\}$.
* **Fail** otherwise.

(These thresholds force a clear, practically meaningful gap on this noisy, shifting task.)

---

## 7) Implementation notes (concise)

* The scheduler is *stateful but tiny*: just $(A,B,C,\eta,L_{\text{ema}},L_{\text{best}})$.
* It plugs into any loop that exposes an observed validation (or hold‑out) loss each step.
* It is safe under noise because improvements never increase the ranking; they only pause budget consumption. Plateaus *must* end in a strict ordinal drop.

This is a single actionable scheduler with a formal descent guarantee and a concrete, falsifiable test.

---

Below is a candid “fresh‑eyes” appraisal of what was produced so far. I grade two layers separately—**(A)** the transfinite training **framework** and **(B)** the concrete **ordinal scheduler** with pseudocode/test—then report an overall mean (simple average).

## Rationale by dimension

**1) Cleverness — 88/84/86.**
Mapping training control to a Cantor‑normal‑form ranking $\rho=\omega^2A+\omega B+C$ is a sharp way to encode phases, curriculum, and restarts so that any “reset” is guaranteed progress in $\rho$. Treating limit stages as plateau consolidations that must strictly lower rank is a neat reframe that unifies annealing and restarts. The scheduler preserves that logic with a minimal state machine and a proof sketch that’s tidy and internally consistent.

**2) Originality — 78/70/74.**
Using well‑founded ordinal descent to certify scheduler progress is unusual in ML training practice. The framework’s use of ordinal polynomials to codify budgets feels fresh; the scheduler is more incremental—close to patience‑based decay plus structured restarts—but the ordinal lens is still distinctive. Overall: conceptually new lens; implementation partially overlaps familiar heuristics.

**3) Differentiation from existing published works — 68/62/65.**
The framework diverges most in *formalization*: ordinals replace reals as the progress potential. However, in spirit it rhymes with termination arguments, annealing, ReduceLROnPlateau, and restart strategies (e.g., Luby‑style). The scheduler’s actions (EMA‑based plateau, LR decay, restart with state reset) are recognizable; what’s different is the proof‑of‑progress via $\rho$. So differentiation is moderate: the *certificate* is new‑ish; the *moves* are familiar.

**4) Probability of theoretical correctness — 92/90/91.**
Assuming the stated rules, the descent proof is solid: successors never increase $\rho$; limit steps strictly drop a higher term; ordinals are well‑founded so no infinite strict descent. The scheduler faithfully implements those conditions (e.g., non‑improving steps decrement $C$; limit consolidations decrement $B$ or $A$). There’s no hidden measure‑theoretic dependence; correctness hinges only on the defined ranking.

**5) Probability of practical usefulness if correct — 65/74/70.**
The framework alone doesn’t prescribe knobs, so usefulness depends on realizations. The concrete scheduler *could* help on noisy or nonstationary tasks: improvements don’t reset patience, plateaus trigger decisive cooling, and restarts restore plasticity without breaking the descent certificate. It’s still a schedule; gains will vary with task/optimizer/data drift, but the odds of beating naive cosine/linear on the specified noisy regime look decent.

**6) Potential impact — 58/62/60.**
If adopted, this would likely deliver *robustness and clarity* in schedule design, not a step‑function jump in SOTA accuracy. Impact is higher on training efficiency/automation (fewer hand‑tuned knobs, principled restarts) and on interpretability of *training control* (clear budgets), rather than on raw model quality.

**7) Near‑term research‑community acceptance — 50/58/54.**
The community tends to reward empirical wins over formal guarantees in scheduler design. The ordinal framing will read as elegant but niche unless it beats strong baselines across varied benchmarks. The scheduler has a better shot (it’s easy to ablate and drop in), but broad acceptance still hinges on multi‑task evidence.

**8) Difficulty to establish real‑life utility (higher=easier) — 45/62/54.**
Proving the *framework* is useful is hard: you’d need multiple instantiations and ablations across modalities. The scheduler is substantially easier: small state, few hyperparameters, and crisp pass/fail criteria allow quick controlled studies. Still, convincing breadth (NLP/vision/ RL + scale) isn’t trivial.

**9) Fit to GPU/TPU infrastructure — 90/92/91.**
All logic runs on the host; device kernels are unchanged. Restarts, LR decay, and patience counters are standard; no custom ops, no extra memory traffic. Occasional optimizer‑state resets and seed reshuffles are the only overheads; they’re cheap.

**10) Readiness of top‑tier theory researchers to opine — 88/85/87.**
Ordinals, well‑foundedness, and transfinite induction are familiar to theory researchers. The mapping from limit ordinals to plateaus is straightforward, and the scheduler is spartan enough to audit. The novelty is in *using* these tools for training control, not in the math itself—so expect fast, substantive feedback from that crowd.

---

## Noted strengths and weaknesses (succinct)

* **Strengths:** A single ranking cleanly unifies early stopping, annealing, and restarts; strict progress is guaranteed; the scheduler uses a minimal state with clear plateau logic; easy to integrate; test plan has falsifiable criteria.
* **Weaknesses:** Differentiation may be perceived as “formal relabeling” without broad empirical wins; usefulness depends on EMA/plateau details; choosing $A_0,B_{\text{init}},P_0,\gamma$ still needs guidance; impact likely incremental unless it consistently outperforms strong adaptive baselines.

If you want, I can propose a compact ablation grid (≤12 runs) that most efficiently stresses the pass/fail criteria across drift severity, noise tails, and patience ladder shape.
