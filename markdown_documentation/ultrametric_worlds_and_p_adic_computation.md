Below is a self‑contained, first‑principles sketch of what “computation over an ultrametric” could look like if we take the p‑adic norm seriously as the geometry of representation, similarity, and update.

---

## 0) Setup: the raw objects

* **Valuation**: For nonzero integers, let $v_p(x)$ be the exponent of $p$ in $x$. Define $|x|_p = p^{-v_p(x)}$ and $d_p(x,y)=|x-y|_p$. So $x,y$ are *close* iff $x\equiv y \ (\mathrm{mod}\ p^k)$ for large $k$.
* **Ultrametric inequality**: $|x+z|_p \le \max(|x|_p,|z|_p)$, with equality whenever the maxima are not tied. Triangles are isosceles; “local geometry” is a rooted $p$-ary tree.
* **Balls are nested or disjoint**: A ball of radius $p^{-k}$ is a congruence class mod $p^k$: $B_k(a)=\{x: x\equiv a \ (\mathrm{mod}\ p^k)\}=a+p^k\mathbb{Z}_p$. Intersect two balls of equal radius → either identical or disjoint. Every point is a center.

Immediate computational intuition: **similarity = longest common residue prefix** (shared digits from the units place upward). Everything—storage, search, learning—should align to this prefix tree.

---

## 1) Representation: addresses in a tree, not points in a space

* **Digits as coordinates**: Write $x=\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i p^i$ with $a_i\in\{0,\dots,p-1\}$. Two numbers are close iff their **low-order** digits match for many levels. The rooted tree branches by $a_0$ at depth 1, then $a_1$ at depth 2, etc.
* **Vectors**: For $d$-dimensional representations, use a product ultrametric such as $\|x\|=\max_j |x_j|_p$. The “ball ⇒ nested/disjoint” story still holds; representations live in a forest of tries.
* **Native coding**: Storing only the first $K$ digits $(a_0,\dots,a_{K-1})$ means storing the ball $x\ (\mathrm{mod}\ p^K)$. That’s *not* approximation; it’s an exact statement about where $x$ lives in the tree.

**Takeaway**: Quantization to $K$ digits is literally choosing a node in the tree. No hack, no loss beyond the chosen resolution.

---

## 2) Accumulation, interference, and error propagation

* **Winner‑dominates addition**: If $|x|_p \ne |z|_p$, then $|x+z|_p=\max(|x|_p,|z|_p)$. The larger‑norm addend dictates the sum at the coarse digits; the smaller one cannot “creep in” the way Euclidean noise does.
* **Ties are rare and structured**: When $|x|_p=|z|_p$, carries can cancel a leading digit and *increase* $v_p(x+z)$. This is structured interference: either one winner or a predictable cancellation that pushes you **deeper** into the tree.
* **Error does not accumulate diffusively**: Small‑valuation changes stay confined to deeper digits; they don’t smear across all coordinates. Propagation is **hierarchy‑local**.

**Optimization implication**: Coarse decisions (small $i$) are stable against deep noise (large $i$); you learn top‑down.

---

## 3) Distance and retrieval: LCP search in $O(\text{depth})$

* **Similarity**: $\mathrm{lcp}(x,y) := \max\{k: x\equiv y \ (\mathrm{mod}\ p^k)\}$. Use $w(x,y)=\alpha^{\mathrm{lcp}(x,y)}$ as a canonical similarity kernel ($\alpha\in(0,1)$).
* **Index**: Store keys in a $p$-ary trie by residues mod $p, p^2,\dots$. Nearest‑neighbor becomes **descend until the branch diverges**, cost $O(K)$ with $K$ the stored precision, independent of corpus size $N$.
* **Batch aggregation**: Node‑level statistics cache sums/counts per prefix. Many queries share upper prefixes, so computation amortizes.

**Result**: Hard attention (“pick deepest common ancestor”) is native and sublinear.

---

## 4) “Gradients” without an inner product

There’s no natural Euclidean inner product here. But the valuation induces a **coarse‑to‑fine partial order** on information.

Define per‑parameter digits $\theta=\sum_{i=0}^{K-1} a_i p^i$. Suppose a loss $L$ depends on the model via outputs that are functions of residues up to some depth.

* **Local influence test**: For each depth $i$, evaluate (or estimate) the loss change $\Delta_i$ from toggling $a_i$ by $\pm 1 \ (\mathrm{mod}\ p)$ while freezing coarser digits $a_0,\dots,a_{i-1}$. Coarser digits dominate; deep digits affect only within their subtrees.
* **Valuation descent**: Choose the smallest $i$ with $\Delta_i<0$; update $a_i\leftarrow a_i+\mathrm{sign}(\Delta_i)$ and leave deeper digits untouched. Only if no improvement exists at depth $i$ do we permit changes at $i{+}1$.
* **Momentum in depth**: Track persistence of the chosen $i$. If the same $i$ improves loss across batches, permit progress to $i{+}1$. This enforces stable **top‑down refinement**.

This is “gradient‑like” because it follows sensitivity, but it lives on digits and valuations, not dot products. It also makes **updates extremely sparse**: for a parameter you change O(1) digits per step.

---

## 5) Linearity, convolution, and what invariance means

* **Linearity**: Over p‑adic scalars, linear maps that are 1‑Lipschitz ($|Ax|_p \le \|x\|_p$) necessarily respect the hierarchy: the output’s coarse digits depend only on input’s equal‑or‑coarser digits. The induced matrices are **block upper‑triangular by depth** in a prefix basis.
* **Convolution** (ultrametric analog): Euclidean convolution ties values at neighboring translations; here “neighbors” are **siblings under a common ancestor at fixed depth**. A natural filter shares weights across all subtrees at depth $k$, i.e., *prefix‑invariant* mixing among siblings. Computation: for each node at depth $k$, combine its children via a shared small kernel; reuse kernel at every node of depth $k$.
* **Spectral view without spectra**: Because balls are clopen and nested, transforms that alternately **coarsen** (aggregate to parent) and **detail** (distribute to children) form an orthogonal‑like decomposition on the tree. Layers that commute with coarsenings are the ultrametric analog of shift‑equivariant convolutions.

**Net effect**: CNN‑like weight sharing exists, but across **siblings at fixed depth**, not across Euclidean translations.

---

## 6) Attention in a tree

* **Score**: $s(q,k)=f(\mathrm{lcp}(q,k))$, monotone in shared depth. No dot products, no angles.
* **Aggregation**: Because $|\sum|_p=\max|\,\cdot\,|_p$ typically, softmax‑like smoothing is unnecessary; a **max‑by‑depth** is the natural aggregator. Ties (same depth) are resolved within that node using residues mod $p^{k+1}$ or counts.
* **Complexity**: Build a per‑depth index; attention reduces to walking the query path and reading cached aggregates at the deepest common node. That’s $O(K)$ time.

This yields **hard, exactly sparse attention** for free.

---

## 7) Discretization, quantization, and pruning are native

* **Discretization**: Truncation at depth $K$ means replacing $x$ by its congruence class mod $p^K$. That’s an *exact* operation: you collapse to a ball and keep every property that’s invariant above that depth.
* **Quantization**: Using $p\in\{2,4,8,16\}$ maps digits to bits/nibbles/bytes. No post‑hoc rounding; parameters *are* digits.
* **Pruning**: If an entire subtree’s digits never affect loss (no queries land there), delete that subtree. Because balls are disjoint, removing a subtree is lossless for all inputs outside it. Storage collapses to the **support of visited prefixes**.

Memory becomes **proportional to used prefixes**, not model width × precision.

---

## 8) Sequence modeling, memory, and retrieval

* **Time as a hierarchy**: Segment positions by their highest power of $p$ dividing the index. That induces a canonical multi‑resolution pyramid (coarse checkpoints at multiples of $p^k$). Recurrent updates can be scheduled **only on indices with high valuation**, amortizing cost across scales.
* **Context as prefix**: Map token histories to keys by hashing to p‑adic integers; the *context cell* is the node at the deepest level where the current history matches prior cases. Reading = descend; writing = update that node’s small table. This is a *context tree* memory with O(1) per‑step cost in precision.
* **Retrieval**: At query time, perform LCP search; pull the cached statistic at that node (or blend with its ancestors). This naturally handles variable‑length dependencies: deeper matches mean finer context.

Training and inference become **prefix‑indexed table lookups + tiny updates**.

---

## 9) Concrete training dynamics that fit the geometry

**Parameterization**

* Store every weight/bias as $K$ base‑$p$ digits. Group parameters by the tree depth they first influence (coarse to fine). Keep per‑node caches of forward contributions.

**Forward pass**

* For MLP‑like units: compute with small integer tables per node (e.g., a lookup for the residue pattern at that depth) plus additive carries to deeper nodes. Because winner‑dominates addition, many branches short‑circuit early.
* For attention‑like units: descend the key trie along the query’s digits, read the deepest node’s aggregate, optionally mix with its ancestor aggregates.

**Backward/update (digit‑local)**

* For each touched node, evaluate $\Delta_i$ for a *few* candidate digit flips (often just $\pm1$ mod $p$). Pick the smallest $i$ that helps; update a single digit and refresh only caches on that path.
* **Coarse‑to‑fine schedule**: Don’t open depth $i{+}1$ until $i$ stabilizes across minibatches. This matches the fact that deeper digits cannot affect coarser mismatches.

**Regularization**

* Penalize using deep digits unless they buy loss; prefer solutions that resolve conflicts at shallow depths (bigger balls). This packs information high in the tree and makes pruning trivial.

**Why this can crush latency & memory**

* Integer digits, tiny tables, path‑only updates. No dense matmuls; most compute is pointer chasing + small accumulations along O(depth) nodes.
* Indexing and attention are $O(K)$; K can be 8–16 in practice with $p=16$. Memory scales with number of *active* prefixes, not parameter count × float precision.

---

## 10) What “linearity” buys us operationally

* **1‑Lipschitz maps by design**: If every layer is depth‑nonexpansive (coarse digits depend only on equal‑or‑coarser inputs), the whole network is a contraction on deep noise. This yields stable training without tuning norms—the geometry enforces it.
* **Block structure**: In a prefix basis, linear maps are upper‑triangular; solving or inverting them is linear‑time in the number of blocks. Precomputation of parent/child summaries makes repeated inference extremely fast.

---

## 11) A concrete ultrametric “toolbox”

* **Prefix‑shared MLP (PS‑MLP)**: At each depth $k$, a tiny $p\times$table transforms sibling activations; outputs propagate to depth $k$ and maybe one level deeper. Weight sharing is per‑depth, not per‑position.
* **Ancestor‑attention (AA)**: Score by shared‑depth; pick deepest node; read its cached value. Multi‑head = use multiple independent hashings/permutations into different p‑tries to mitigate collisions.
* **Valuation descent optimizer (VDO)**: Digitwise coordinate descent with per‑depth learning schedule and carry‑aware tie handling.
* **Anytime precision**: Run with depth budget $K'\le K$ at inference; it’s exact at that resolution. If latency is tight, stop early; outputs are the correct ultrametric coarsenings, not approximations.
* **Lossless pruning**: Periodically sweep tries to remove unreachable subtrees and merge identical sibling tables. Storage shrinks monotonically as the model specializes.

---

## 12) Failure modes and handling (still first‑principles)

* **Ties/cancellations**: When competing signals share the same valuation, a carry can deepen the result. Detect ties and either (a) break using deeper digits, or (b) add a tiny *structured* dither at that depth.
* **No total order**: There’s no meaningful “greater than” for p‑adics. All decisions must be norm/valuation‑based or residue‑based, never ordered comparisons.
* **Collision management**: With hashing into p‑tries, collisions occur; multiple heads and reservoir sampling at deep nodes mitigate this while preserving $O(K)$ time.

---

## 13) Why this reframes modeling

* **Similarity = ancestry**: Patterns are “the same” if they live in the same ball—i.e., share a long, low‑order prefix. This favors **exemplar + exception** representations: a coarse prototype at shallow depth and unrolled idiosyncrasies deeper down the same branch.
* **Learning = specialization**: Start with a few coarse rules (shallow digits), then specialize only for sub‑populations that require it (descend). Catastrophic forgetting is reduced; disjoint subtrees don’t interfere.
* **Computation = sparse walks**: Inference is a handful of trie descents, table reads, and small integer updates—hardware‑friendly and cache‑friendly.

---

## 14) Tiny worked example (scalar intuition)

Let $p=5$, precision $K=3$. Suppose a unit’s output is a digit table $T_k[\text{residue mod }5^{k+1}]$ at each depth $k\in\{0,1,2\}$, combined by winner‑dominates addition from shallow to deep.

* Input $x$ enters; compute $r_0=x \bmod 5$, look up $T_0[r_0]$ (coarse). If that already matches the target within tolerance measured at depth 0, stop. Otherwise compute $r_1=x \bmod 25$, refine with $T_1[r_1]$, etc.
* Updating the model changes exactly one table entry $T_i[r_i]$ by $\pm 1 \ (\mathrm{mod}\ 5)$, chosen at the smallest $i$ that improves loss. No other entries move. Caches update only along one path.

This is the scalar seed of the higher‑dimensional story.

---

## 15) Summary of conjectured advantages

* **Latency**: $O(K)$ per query for attention/retrieval; $O(\#\text{active nodes})$ per layer. Integer tables beat dense FP matmuls on both compute and memory bandwidth.
* **Memory**: Stores only used prefixes; native quantization to base $p$ digits; aggressive, *lossless* subtree pruning.
* **Stability**: Error confined to deep digits; coarse decisions are robust; training is naturally coarse‑to‑fine.
* **Sparsity**: Hard attention and digitwise updates are the default, not a trick.

---

If one were to build this tomorrow, the most “native” recipe would be: represent everything as base‑$p$ tries; define layers as depth‑shared sibling mixers; do attention by longest common prefix; learn by valuation‑ordered digit flips; cache node aggregates; prune dead subtrees. The geometry does the rest.

---

Below is a single “inevitable” algorithmic core that drops straight out of p‑adic/ultrametric structure. It keeps only operations that respect nested/disjoint balls and longest‑common‑prefix (LCP) symmetry.

---

## Core primitive: **LCP‑Tree Attention (LTA)**

**Objects**

* Base $p$, depth $K$. Keys/queries are $K$ base‑$p$ digits $(a_0,\dots,a_{K-1})$; the node at depth $d$ encodes residue $\bmod\, p^{d+1}$.
* A dynamic $p$-ary trie $T$. Each node $u$ at depth $d$ stores:

  * **occupancy** bit $b_u\in\{0,1\}$.
  * **aggregate** $S_u\in \mathbb{Z}_p^m$ (small, integer, per‑head vector).
  * optional **count** $c_u\in\mathbb{N}$ for conflict heuristics.
* A small **per‑depth mixing map** $M_d:\mathbb{Z}_p^m\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_p^m$ that is 1‑Lipschitz in the p‑adic norm (upper‑triangular by depth; concrete form below).

**Read (attention)**

* Given query $q$, walk digits from depth 0 to $K-1$ until the next child is unoccupied; return the **deepest occupied ancestor** $u^\*(q)$ and output

  $$
  \hat{y}(q)=M_{\mathrm{depth}(u^\*)}\,S_{u^\*}.
  $$

This is “attend to the deepest shared ball.” No dot products, no softmax—only LCP.

**Write (context/update)**

* Given a key–value pair $(k,v)$, set $b_u\gets 1$ along the path of $k$ and update aggregates $S_u$ along (a subset of) that path with a monoid operation $\oplus$ (e.g., modular add or capped add). Which node to update is decided by the step rule below.

**Complexity**

* Each read or write touches at most $K=O(\log_p n)$ nodes. For a sequence of length $n$, total time $O(n\log n)$. Memory is proportional to the number of **active prefixes** rather than $nK$.

This is the native attention because the ultrametric distance *is* the LCP depth. Balls are clopen, nested, and disjoint; the deepest occupied ancestor is the unique maximizer of “closeness.”

---

## Parameterization (nothing Euclidean)

* **Digits:** keys/queries $k,q\in\{0,\dots,p-1\}^K$.
* **Aggregates:** $S_u\in\mathbb{Z}_p^m$ (e.g., $m=16$). We use component‑wise modular add $\oplus$ as the aggregate monoid; it preserves 1‑Lipschitzness under $|\cdot|_p$.
* **Per‑depth map:** $M_d(z)=U_d\,z$ where $U_d\in \mathbb{Z}_p^{m\times m}$ is **unit upper‑triangular** (ones on the diagonal). This makes $M_d$ 1‑Lipschitz and **depth‑causal**: coarse output digits depend only on equal‑or‑coarser input digits.
* **Heads:** $H$ independent tries with different base‑$p$ hashings of the raw token/key; outputs are combined by depth‑wise modular add. Heads reduce collisions without breaking tree symmetry.

---

## Initialization

* Choose $p\in\{4,8,16\}$, $K$ so that $p^K\approx n^\gamma$ with $\gamma\in[0.8,1.2]$ (keeps collision rate small but tables tiny).
* Set all $b_u=0, S_u=0$. Set each $U_d$ to identity (or identity plus strictly super‑diagonal ±1 digits to break ties).
* Pre‑allocate depth arrays with **succinct bitsets** for occupancy and a contiguous pool for $S_u$ (see cache section).

---

## Step rule (replaces gradients): **Valuation‑Ordered Local Fix (VOLF)**

Goal: fix errors at the *shallowest* node that explains them; specialize only when necessary. This matches ultrametric stability (coarse decisions resist deep noise).

For a supervised pair $(q, y^\*)$ and its current prediction $\hat{y}(q)$:

1. Compute residual $e=y^\* \ominus \hat{y}(q)\in \mathbb{Z}_p^m$ (component‑wise modular difference).
2. Let $P(q)=\{u_0,\dots,u_d\}$ be the ancestors of $q$ up to $u^\*(q)$ (occupied deepest). For $i=0,\dots,d$:

   * **Compatibility test:** if writing $e$ at node $u_i$ would *not* flip the majority sign of residuals already recorded at $u_i$ (tracked via a small counter vector $R_{u_i}\in\{-1,0,1\}^m$), accept $i$ and break.
3. Update the accepted node $u_i$:

   * $S_{u_i}\gets S_{u_i}\oplus \eta_i \odot e$, with scalar $\eta_i\in\{0,1\}$ (often 1; optional depth‑dependent cap).
   * $R_{u_i}\gets \mathrm{clip}(R_{u_i}+ \mathrm{sign}(e),[-r,r])$ (tiny saturating counters to steer future compatibility).
4. If no ancestor passes, write at $u^\*(q)$ (deepest) to confine the change.

**Why it works here:** Writing at an ancestor modifies predictions **only** for queries inside that ball (nested/disjoint). VOLF is a greedy, digit‑local coordinate descent in valuation order; it cannot spill errors outside the ball in which it writes.

---

## Retrieval subroutine (provably cache‑friendly)

**Layout**

* For each depth $d$, store nodes contiguously in an array $A_d$. Maintain a succinct **occupancy bitset** $B_d$ over the universe of active residues at depth $d$, plus a rank/select structure for O(1) index mapping from a residue $r_d$ to its position in $A_d$.
* Store all $U_d$ contiguously per depth.

**Lookup(q)**

* Compute residues incrementally: $r_0=a_0,\; r_{d}=r_{d-1}+a_d p^d$.
* For $d=0\ldots K-1$:

  * If $B_d[r_d]=0$, break and return $A_{d-1}[ \mathrm{rank}(B_{d-1}, r_{d-1}) ]$.
* Else return $A_{K-1}[ \mathrm{rank}(B_{K-1}, r_{K-1}) ]$.

**Cache argument**

* Each step touches exactly one bitset word and one contiguous array entry; thus at most $K$ cache lines (often $\approx\!K/(\text{words per line})$). No pointer chasing; addresses are computable. This is the ultrametric analog of a perfect‑hash trie.

---

## “Native attention” end‑to‑end routine

For a stream $\{(q_t,k_t,v_t,y^\*_t)\}_{t=1}^n$:

* **Attend:** $\hat{y}_t=\sum_{h=1}^{H} M^{(h)}_{\mathrm{depth}(u^\*_h(q_t))} S^{(h)}_{u^\*_h(q_t)}$.
* **Predict loss:** $\ell_t=d_p(\hat{y}_t,y^\*_t)$ (e.g., 0–1 on earliest differing digit, or weighted by digit importance).
* **Update:** Apply VOLF on each head independently using $(q_t,y^\*_t)$; insert $(k_t,v_t)$ by turning on occupancy along its path if new.

All operations are integer/bitset; per‑token cost $O(HK)$.

---

## Toy benchmark (fast falsification)

**Task A: LCP retrieval**

* Generate $N$ keys $k_i\in\{0,\dots,p-1\}^K$ uniformly. Assign each node $u$ at random depth a random label $y_u\in \mathbb{Z}_p^m$. For each sample, pick a key $k$, generate a query $q$ by copying the first $D$ digits of $k$ and randomizing deeper digits; set target $y^\*=y_{u}$ where $u$ is the shared node at depth $D$.
* **Claim:** LTA+VOLF reaches exact training accuracy $=1$ in one pass when $\oplus$ is modular add and $M_d=I$; baselines that do not exploit LCP structure must approximate set partitioning and won’t hit 1.0 without emulating the trie.

**Task B: Exceptions under hierarchy**

* As above, but flip the label for a small fraction $\epsilon$ of *leaves only*. Correct solver: write coarse label at parent nodes; memorize exceptions at leaves. Measure (i) accuracy, (ii) number of updated nodes. **Prediction:** nodes updated $\approx$ $|\text{internal clusters}|+\epsilon N$, far below $N$.

If LTA fails either task (can’t hit 1.0 on A or can’t localize exceptions on B), the approach is wrong.

---

## Predicted scaling laws (speculative but forced by the geometry)

* **Latency:** Per token $T_{\text{step}}=\Theta(HK)$ with $K=\lceil\log_p(n/\rho)\rceil$ for target collision rate $\rho$. Thus $T_{\text{step}}=\Theta(H\log n)$. In contrast, dense attention is $\Theta(n)$ per token.
* **Memory:** $\Theta(Hm\,\sum_{d} |\mathcal{U}_d|)$, where $|\mathcal{U}_d|$ is the number of **occupied** residues at depth $d$. On heavy‑tailed data, $|\mathcal{U}_d|$ grows sub‑geometrically and total memory is $\tilde{O}(n)$ with a small constant; pruning of empty subtrees is lossless.
* **Error vs depth:** For targets determined by at most $D$ leading digits, expected error after training to depth $K$ decays geometrically: $\mathbb{E}[\text{err}(K)]\le C\alpha^{K-D}$ for some $\alpha<1$ tied to noise/collision rate.
* **Data reuse:** Node‑level reuse multiplies effective batch size with depth; statistics at shallow nodes get $p^d$ times more hits, accelerating stabilization of coarse digits.

---

## Failure modes (and diagnostics)

1. **Non‑hierarchical similarity:** If the task’s similarity is not congruence‑based, deepest‑common‑ancestor is not predictive. Symptom: frequent back‑and‑forth writes between siblings; diagnostic: high oscillation of $R_u$ signs at shallow depths.
2. **Adversarial collisions:** Hashing into digits produces many collisions at depth $D$. Fix: increase $H$, increase $K$, or switch hash; all preserve asymptotics.
3. **Tie cascades:** Many equal‑depth candidates for updates. Remedy: per‑depth tiny dither on $U_d$ or fixed child ordering; track tie frequency—if above threshold, add a head.
4. **Label drift across time:** If ground truth changes for the same ball, VOLF will push updates deeper. Monitor drift by counting reversals at a node; if frequent, mark the node non‑generalizable and force leaf‑level writes.

---

## Minimal pseudocode (compact)

```python
# Parameters: p, K, H, m; per-depth U[d] unit upper triangular in Z_p
# Tries: for each head h and depth d:
#   B[h][d]: succinct bitset; A[h][d]: array of S; R[h][d]: array of small counters

def lookup(q):
    y = [0]*m
    for h in range(H):
        r = 0; last_idx = None; last_d = -1
        for d in range(K):
            r += q[d]*(p**d)
            if not B[h][d].test(r): break
            last_idx = B[h][d].rank(r); last_d = d
        if last_d >= 0:
            s = A[h][last_d][last_idx]
            y = (y + U[h][last_d] @ s) % p
    return y

def volf_step(q, y_star):
    y = lookup(q); e = (y_star - y) % p
    if e == [0]*m: return
    for h in range(H):
        r = 0; path = []
        for d in range(K):
            r += q[d]*(p**d); path.append((d,r))
            if not B[h][d].test(r): break
        # choose shallowest compatible node
        chosen = None
        for (d,r) in path:
            idx = B[h][d].rank(r)
            if compatible(R[h][d][idx], e):
                chosen = (d,idx); break
        if chosen is None: chosen = path[-1]; d, r = chosen; idx = B[h][d].rank(r)
        A[h][d][idx] = (A[h][d][idx] + e) % p
        R[h][d][idx] = saturating_add(R[h][d][idx], sign(e))
```

All arrays per depth are contiguous; bitsets support O(1) rank/test. Memory traffic per call is O(HK).

---

## Experiment plan (<72 GPU‑hours, CPU‑heavy OK)

**Phase 1: Synthetic falsifiers (≤2 hours total)**

1. **Task A** (LCP retrieval): $p=16,K=8,H=1,m=8$, $N=1$–10M samples. One pass, batch size 1. Expect 100% train acc and >99% test when hashes collide only at deep levels. Record updates/node count.
2. **Task B** (exceptions): same, with $\epsilon\in\{0.1,1,5\}\%$ leaf exceptions. Expect updates $\approx$ internal clusters + $\epsilon N$, shallow $R_u$ stable.

**Phase 2: Causal sequence toy LM (≤24 GPU‑hours)**

* Character‑level stream; define targets as a function of the last $D$ digits of a rolling hash of the context (so ground truth is *exactly* ultrametric). Compare:

  * LTA+VOLF with $H\in\{1,2,4\}$, $K\in\{8,12\}$.
  * A small dot‑product transformer with similar parameter count.
* Metrics: accuracy vs context length, tokens/sec, RAM, cache misses. Expect LTA: tokens/sec scales $\propto 1/\log n$, flat cache‑miss rate per token, exact accuracy once $K\ge D$.

**Phase 3: Real text retrieval (≤40 GPU‑hours)**

* Map tokens to p‑adic keys via fast universal hash; queries are spans; labels are document IDs for nearest neighbor under LCP depth (ground truth defined by hash collisions). Expect LTA to match exact NN while running \~O($n\log n$) build and O($\log n$) query; baselines approximate or pay O($n$) per query.

**Ablations**

* Vary $p$, $K$, heads $H$. Turn off VOLF’s “shallowest compatible” gate → measure generalization loss and update count blow‑up.
* Replace unit‑upper $U_d$ with identity → confirm similar accuracy, slightly slower tie resolution.

**What would convince a skeptic**

* Exact solves on Tasks A/B with a single linear‑time pass.
* Throughput curves showing per‑token time $\sim c\,H\log_p n$ and flat cache‑miss counts vs $n$.
* Memory scaling tied to active prefixes, with lossless pruning reports (drop empty subtrees, unchanged accuracy).

---

## Why this is “inevitable” under ultrametrics

* **Similarity = LCP depth.** The deepest occupied ancestor is the unique nearest ball. Any mechanism that doesn’t pick that node is geometrically inconsistent.
* **Updates must be ball‑local.** Writing outside the chosen ball either does nothing or corrupts disjoint data; VOLF’s shallow‑first rule is the only stable, generalizing choice.
* **Compute = path walks.** Because balls are nested/disjoint and every point is a center, all useful operations reduce to $O(K)$ path traversals and node‑local arithmetic. Hence the $O(n\log n)$ total with $K=\Theta(\log n)$.

If this picture is wrong, the falsifiers above will show it immediately; if it’s right, you get hard‑sparse, cache‑friendly attention with integer arithmetic, native quantization, and lossless pruning—computational behavior that is hard to get from Euclidean geometry without elaborate tricks.

---

Below is a candid, first‑principles evaluation of the two write‑ups (the ultrametric framing and the LTA+VOLF core). For every axis, scores are 0–100 (higher is better). For the “difficulty” axis, I interpret “better” as **easier to establish convincingly** (so higher = lower difficulty).

### Quick scores

### Cleverness — **86**

The core move—identifying LCP depth as the intrinsic “nearest neighbor,” then building attention, updates, and caching entirely around nested/disjoint balls—is tight and self‑consistent. The valuation‑ordered update rule (VOLF) that modifies the shallowest compatible node is an elegant consequence of the strong triangle inequality, and the unit‑upper‑triangular 1‑Lipschitz maps line up with “coarse‑to‑fine” causality. The synthesis is clever because each ingredient is forced by the geometry rather than added ad hoc.

### Originality — **73**

Using p‑adic valuation to reinterpret quantization/pruning as *native semantics* and to motivate a fully discrete, cache‑aligned attention is a fresh packaging. The “inevitability” stance (LTA as the only symmetry‑respecting attention) is also distinctive. However, several components rhyme with known ideas (tries, context‑tree memories, hierarchical MoE, product‑quantization‑like discretization), which trims the score.

### Differentiation from existing published work — **49**

Large parts would feel familiar to readers who know digital search trees, context‑tree weighting, nearest‑ancestor retrieval, or hierarchical memories. What differentiates this is the insistence on ultrametric semantics for *every* design choice (updates, stability, Lipschitz structure). That’s a conceptual shift, but absent strong empirical breaks from those relatives, differentiation is moderate rather than dramatic.

### Probability of being theoretically correct — **90**

Claims tied directly to ultrametrics are on solid ground: balls are nested/disjoint; LCP depth really is the appropriate notion of closeness; deepest‑occupied‑ancestor retrieval is optimal under that distance; unit upper‑triangular maps are 1‑Lipschitz in the p‑adic norm; path‑only updates can’t spill into disjoint balls. The only caveats are edge cases (tie handling, hash collisions), which the design acknowledges.

### Probability of practical usefulness (if correct) — **62**

Where similarity is truly hierarchical or can be made so by hashing (indexing, retrieval, exception‑handling, symbolic pipelines, structured logs), the approach should work well: O(log n) lookups, tiny integer updates, and lossless pruning are compelling. For dense, continuously varying tasks (e.g., end‑to‑end LM perplexity on natural text without a bespoke hashing regime), utility is less certain; the geometry can mismatch the data manifold, leading to specialization overhead or over‑fragmentation.

### Potential impact — **57**

If borne out, the biggest wins are latency and RAM for retrieval/memory‑heavy workloads, plus rigorous interpretability via explicit ancestry and node‑level statistics. That’s meaningful but likely specialized rather than field‑wide: it could reshape certain subsystems (RAG indices, cache‑LMs, rule‑with‑exceptions learners) more than it overturns dense gradient‑based training.

### Probability of near‑term community acceptance — **41**

Near‑term acceptance is hampered by (i) non‑differentiable updates, (ii) pointer‑heavy layouts that don’t showcase well on GPU leaderboards, and (iii) the need for bespoke benchmarks where ultrametric similarity is the right ground truth. A clear, order‑of‑magnitude speedup on a respected retrieval or caching task would raise this quickly; absent that, reception will be cautious.

### Difficulty to convincingly establish usefulness (higher = easier) — **45**

It’s straightforward to win on synthetic LCP tasks, but convincing proof on *real* workloads requires careful construction: robust hashing regimes, multi‑head collision mitigation, and comparisons against strong approximate‑NN and retrieval baselines. That’s doable, but stitching it into end‑to‑end systems (and showing wall‑clock advantages under realistic batching) is nontrivial.

### Fit to existing accelerators (GPU/TPU/etc.) — **48**

The design prefers contiguous array/bitset scans along short paths—great for CPU caches and potentially custom near‑memory logic, but not a natural match to dense matmul engines. Some batching tricks (warp‑level ballots, coalesced bitset probes, fused per‑depth kernels) help, yet you won’t saturate tensor cores. It’s better aligned with CPUs/FPGAs or hybrid pipelines where the dense blocks are elsewhere.

### How prepared a top‑1% theory researcher is to opine — **68**

A strong theorist can reason well about ultrametrics, tries, and tree‑structured algorithms without specialized p‑adic background. They’ll quickly test the cache‑friendliness claim, the O(log n) retrieval, and the stability arguments. However, practical hardware details and the empirical fit to messy data may sit a bit outside their usual toolkit, moderating the score.

## One‑paragraph overall verdict

As a geometry‑first program, this is coherent and disciplined: if the world is ultrametric (or can be made to look that way via hashing), then LCP‑Tree Attention plus valuation‑ordered updates is a natural, perhaps *inevitable*, kernel. The theoretical pieces are solid; the main risk is ecological—many real signals are only partially hierarchical, and modern hardware rewards dense linear algebra. Expect the approach to shine in retrieval/memory and “exceptions‑to‑rules” regimes, with real wins in latency and RAM, while struggling to displace dense backprop in broad generative modeling without hybridization. The fastest path to raising multiple scores is a clean, apples‑to‑apples wall‑clock win on a respected retrieval/cache benchmark with identical quality, followed by an end‑to‑end ablation showing lossless pruning and exact anytime precision.
