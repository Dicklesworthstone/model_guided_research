Below is a self‑contained construction that uses only the combinatorics of finite abstract simplicial complexes with chosen orientations. Nothing here appeals to embeddings, geometry, or prior literature; every operator arises from faces/cofaces and their signed incidences.

---

## 0) Setup: chains, cochains, orientations

Let $K$ be a finite abstract simplicial complex with oriented $k$-simplices $K_k=\{\sigma^k_i\}_{i=1}^{n_k}$. For each $k$, define the signed **boundary matrix**

$$
D_k \in \{-1,0,1\}^{n_{k-1}\times n_k},\qquad
(D_k)_{\tau,\sigma}=\begin{cases}
\mathrm{sgn}(\tau\prec\sigma) & \text{if }\tau\text{ is a \((k\!-\!1)\)-face of }\sigma\\
0 & \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
$$

so that the boundary map $\partial_k:C_k\to C_{k-1}$ is $\partial_k = D_k$ and $\partial_{k-1}\partial_k=0$ (i.e., $D_{k-1}D_{k}=0$).

Cochains $C^k=\mathbb{R}^{n_k}$ carry features on oriented $k$-simplices. We treat model states $x_k\in \mathbb{R}^{n_k\times d_k}$ as **$k$-cochains with channels**. Orientation reversal multiplies the corresponding coordinate by $-1$.

Two canonical signed, same‑dimension operators:

$$
\boxed{B^{\downarrow}_k := D_k^\top D_k}\qquad
\boxed{B^{\uparrow}_k := D_{k+1}D_{k+1}^\top}
$$

* $B^{\downarrow}_k$ connects $k$-simplices that share a $(k\!-\!1)$-face; entries carry the product of face signs.
* $B^{\uparrow}_k$ connects $k$-simplices that are cofaces of a common $(k\!+\!1)$-simplex; entries carry the product of coface signs.

Unsigned variants use $|D_k|$ in place of $D_k$.

The **$k$-Laplacian** (purely combinatorial) is

$$
\boxed{L_k := D_k^\top D_k + D_{k+1}D_{k+1}^\top = B^{\downarrow}_k + B^{\uparrow}_k.}
$$

Its nullspace $\mathcal{H}^k=\ker D_k \cap \ker D_{k+1}^\top$ are the **harmonic $k$-cochains** (cycles with no coboundary and no boundary).

---

## 1) Axioms that force the form of updates

From bare combinatorics:

**A1 (Locality by incidence).** Updates for a $k$-simplex may depend only on its faces, cofaces, and same‑dimension neighbors obtained by at most two steps of face/coface lifting. This forbids arbitrary pairwise mixing.

**A2 (Equivariance under simplicial automorphisms).** For any vertex permutation that preserves incidences (a simplicial automorphism), there are permutation matrices $P_k$ with $P_{k-1}D_k=D_kP_k$. Updates must commute: $\Phi_k(P_k x)=P_k\Phi_k(x)$.

**A3 (Orientation equivariance).** Flipping the orientation of any $k$-simplex acts by a diagonal sign matrix $S_k$ with $S_{k-1}D_k=D_kS_k$. Updates must commute: $\Phi_k(S_k x)=S_k\Phi_k(x)$.

**A4 (Boundary respect).** No operator may create fake cofaces or faces; all flows must be composed from $D_k$ and $D_k^\top$. On top/bottom dimensions, the missing maps are identically zero. (This enforces “no messages beyond the boundary.”)

**Consequence.** The only allowed linear, structure‑aware operators on $C^k$ are polynomials in

$$
I,\quad D_k^\top,\quad D_k,\quad B^{\downarrow}_k,\quad B^{\uparrow}_k,
$$

with learnable right‑side channel mixers. Any mixing that ignores these (e.g., arbitrary dense $n_k\times n_k$ matrices) breaks A2–A4.

---

## 2) Incidence‑defined attention (no pairwise feature similarity)

Attention weights must come from **shared higher‑order incidence**. For $k$-simplices $\sigma,\theta$:

* **Face‑shared multiplicity (signed)**: $(B^{\downarrow}_k)_{\sigma\theta}$ equals the signed count of $(k\!-\!1)$-faces shared by $\sigma,\theta$.
* **Coface‑shared multiplicity (signed)**: $(B^{\uparrow}_k)_{\sigma\theta}$ equals the signed count of $(k\!+\!1)$-simplices that have both $\sigma,\theta$ as faces.

Define per‑head structural scores as any **monotone** function of these counts, e.g.

$$
S^{(h)}_k := a_h B^{\downarrow}_k + b_h B^{\uparrow}_k + c_h I
$$

or deeper polynomials $p_h(B^{\downarrow}_k,B^{\uparrow}_k)$. Normalize row‑wise to produce attention:

$$
A^{(h)}_k := \mathrm{row\_norm}\big(\,[S^{(h)}_k]_+\,\big),
$$

using either softmax or degree normalization. Since $B^{\downarrow}_k,B^{\uparrow}_k$ commute with $P_k,S_k$, so do $A^{(h)}_k$. Thus attention is **purely structural and orientation‑aware** by construction.

Unsigned variants $|B^{\downarrow}_k|,|B^{\uparrow}_k|$ can be mixed with signed ones to separate “coherent vs. incoherent” orientation effects.

---

## 3) The only message‑passing that satisfies A1–A4

Let $x_{k}$ be current $k$-cochain features; $x_{k-1},x_{k+1}$ are adjacent‑dimension states. A general update that **exhausts** what A1–A4 allow is:

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
\tilde x_k &= \sum_{h=1}^H A^{(h)}_k\, x_k W^{(h)}_{\mathrm{self}}
\;+\; D_k^\top\,x_{k-1}\,W^{\downarrow}
\;+\; D_{k+1}\,x_{k+1}\,W^{\uparrow}
\\[-2pt]
&\quad+\; B^{\downarrow}_k\,x_k W^{\lrcorner}
\;+\; B^{\uparrow}_k\,x_k W^{\ulcorner}
\;+\; x_k W^{0}
\end{aligned}}
$$

All $W^\bullet$ mix channels only (right multiplies), preserving combinatorial symmetries. Nonlinearities must respect orientation: for scalar channels, any **odd** pointwise nonlinearity $f(s)=-f(-s)$ preserves sign‑equivariance; for vector channels, apply $f$ elementwise or use gated odd functions $f(s)=\mathrm{sgn}(s)\,g(|s|)$.

Notes:

* The three **primitive moves** are exactly those induced by faces ($D_k^\top$), cofaces ($D_{k+1}$), and two‑step same‑dimension interactions ($B^{\downarrow}_k,B^{\uparrow}_k$). Nothing else is incidence‑local and symmetry‑respecting.
* On $k=0$, the down‑term vanishes; on top dimension, the up‑term vanishes.

---

## 4) Memory that cannot break boundaries or orientations

From the algebra $D_{k-1}D_k=0$, $D_{k}D_{k+1}=0$, any $k$-cochain decomposes orthogonally (w\.r.t. the standard inner product) into

$$
\boxed{x_k = \underbrace{D_k^\top p_{k-1}}_{\text{exact}} \;\;+\;\; \underbrace{h_k}_{\text{harmonic}} \;\;+\;\; \underbrace{D_{k+1} q_{k+1}}_{\text{coexact}}},
$$

with $h_k\in\mathcal{H}^k$, for some potentials $p_{k-1}\in C^{k-1}, q_{k+1}\in C^{k+1}$.

Therefore a memory that **must** respect boundaries and orientations keeps **potentials** and **harmonics**:

$$
\boxed{m_k := (p_{k-1},\,h_k,\,q_{k+1})}
$$

and realizes the visible state as $x_k = D_k^\top p_{k-1} + h_k + D_{k+1}q_{k+1}$.

A minimal, symmetry‑respecting recurrent update:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p_{k-1}^{t+1} &= p_{k-1}^{t} + \Gamma^\downarrow_k\!\left(D_k x_k^t,\; x_{k-1}^t\right)\\
q_{k+1}^{t+1} &= q_{k+1}^{t} + \Gamma^\uparrow_k\!\left(D_{k+1}^\top x_k^t,\; x_{k+1}^t\right)\\
h_k^{t+1} &= h_k^{t} + \Pi_{\mathcal{H}^k}\!\Big(\Gamma^{H}_k(x_k^t)\Big),
\end{aligned}
$$

where each $\Gamma^\bullet$ is any channel‑mixer that acts **after** applying $D_k$ or $D_{k+1}^\top$, and $\Pi_{\mathcal{H}^k}$ is the (learnable or fixed) projection onto $\ker L_k$. Because updates touch $p$ via $D_k(\cdot)$ and $q$ via $D_{k+1}^\top(\cdot)$, the reconstructed state **always** remains in exact$\oplus$harmonic$\oplus$coexact, never leaking across the boundary of $K$.

On the bottom/top dimensions, the non‑existent terms are zero (hard boundary conditions). If desired, “relative” vs “absolute” boundary behavior is controlled by whether you keep or kill $h_k$ on boundary‑supported basis vectors.

---

## 5) What symmetry forces (and forbids)

* **Automorphism equivariance.** Because $P_{k-1}D_k=D_kP_k$ and likewise for $D_{k+1}$, any expression built from $I,D_k,D_k^\top,B_k^{\downarrow},B_k^{\uparrow}$ commutes with all $P_k$. Thus the update and memory above are *the* automorphism‑equivariant maps under A1.

* **Orientation equivariance.** Since $S_{k-1}D_k=D_kS_k$, all linear parts commute with every $S_k$. Orientation flips thus change signs of exact and coexact parts consistently; the harmonic part flips only where its basis flips.

* **Forbidden forms.** Any neighbor aggregation not obtainable as a word in $D_k$ and $D_k^\top$ (e.g., arbitrary “graph of $k$-simplices” you hand‑wire) breaks A2 or A4. Any non‑odd scalar nonlinearity breaks A3.

---

## 6) Training signals that reward cross‑dimension consistency

Everything below is derivable from $D_{k-1}D_k=0$ and the decomposition above; no external assumptions are used.

### (i) Down/up consistency losses (Stokes‑style)

For predicted states $\hat x_\bullet$,

$$
\boxed{\mathcal{L}^{\downarrow}_k = \big\|D_k\,\hat x_k - \phi^\downarrow_k(\hat x_{k-1})\big\|^2},\qquad
\boxed{\mathcal{L}^{\uparrow}_k = \big\|D_{k+1}^\top\,\hat x_k - \phi^\uparrow_k(\hat x_{k+1})\big\|^2}
$$

with learnable $\phi^\downarrow_k,\phi^\uparrow_k$ (channel mixers). These force the model to make its $k$-content consistent with its faces and cofaces.

### (ii) Commutator/compatibility penalties

Demand that updates commute with boundary/coboundary:

$$
\boxed{\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{comm}}_k = \big\| D_k\,\Phi_k(x_k) - \Phi_{k-1}(D_k x_k)\big\|^2 + \big\| D_{k+1}^\top\,\Phi_k(x_k) - \Phi_{k+1}(D_{k+1}^\top x_k)\big\|^2.}
$$

This rewards architectures that are natural transformations between cochain spaces.

### (iii) Exact/coexact reconstruction

Introduce latent potentials $\hat p_{k-1},\hat q_{k+1}$ and require

$$
\boxed{\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{pot}}_k = \big\|\hat x_k - D_k^\top \hat p_{k-1} - D_{k+1}\hat q_{k+1}\big\|^2,}
$$

optionally plus a sparsity or capacity budget on $\hat h_k:=\hat x_k - D_k^\top \hat p_{k-1} - D_{k+1}\hat q_{k+1}$ to favor concise harmonic memory.

### (iv) Harmonic preservation / leakage control

Because $\mathcal{H}^k=\ker L_k$,

$$
\boxed{\mathcal{L}^{H}_k = \big\|\Pi_{\mathcal{H}^k}(\hat x_k^{t+1}-\hat x_k^{t})\big\|^2}
$$

keeps long‑range, cycle‑level information persistent. Conversely, enforce decay of non‑harmonic residue:

$$
\boxed{\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{damp}}_k = \big\| (I-\Pi_{\mathcal{H}^k})\,\hat x_k^{t+1}\big\|^2}
$$

in tasks where only topology should remain.

### (v) Orientation coherence

Signed counts already encode orientation. Reinforce it by aligning signs across shared faces/cofaces:

$$
\boxed{\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{orient}}_k = -\!\!\sum_{\sigma\neq\theta}(B^{\downarrow}_k)_{\sigma\theta}\,\langle \hat x_k(\sigma),\hat x_k(\theta)\rangle
\;-\!\!\sum_{\sigma\neq\theta}(B^{\uparrow}_k)_{\sigma\theta}\,\langle \hat x_k(\sigma),\hat x_k(\theta)\rangle.}
$$

This pushes features to agree when orientations cohere and disagree when they oppose.

### (vi) Incidence‑contrastive learning

Positives: pairs with large $|(B^{\downarrow}_k)_{\sigma\theta}|+|(B^{\uparrow}_k)_{\sigma\theta}|$. Negatives: zero‑incidence pairs. InfoNCE on $k$-simplices uses **only** these structural relations.

### (vii) Masked incidence prediction

Randomly mask a subset of $k$-simplices, reconstruct them only from $D_k^\top x_{k-1}$ and $D_{k+1}x_{k+1}$. The loss enforces that faces/cofaces suffice to predict the missing cochain, rewarding cross‑dimensional consistency.

### (viii) Multi‑resolution (0D/1D/2D…)

For tokens (0D), edges (1D), patches (2D):

* tie parameters so that the same $\Phi_k$ family satisfies $\mathcal{L}^{\downarrow}_1$ with the 0D token stream and $\mathcal{L}^{\uparrow}_1$ with the 2D patch stream,
* add a cycle test on 1D: sum of oriented edge features around any 2D face boundary should match the 2D patch feature on that face (a direct Stokes consistency).

---

## 7) Normalization and stability (still purely combinatorial)

Let the unsigned degrees be

$$
\deg^{\downarrow}_k := \mathrm{diag}(|D_k|^\top \mathbf{1}),\qquad
\deg^{\uparrow}_k := \mathrm{diag}(|D_{k+1}|\, \mathbf{1}).
$$

Row‑normalize attention by these, or use symmetric normalizations

$$
\tilde B^{\downarrow}_k = (\deg^{\downarrow}_k)^{-1/2}|B^{\downarrow}_k|(\deg^{\downarrow}_k)^{-1/2},\quad
\tilde B^{\uparrow}_k = (\deg^{\uparrow}_k)^{-1/2}|B^{\uparrow}_k|(\deg^{\uparrow}_k)^{-1/2},
$$

which remain automorphism‑ and orientation‑equivariant. On boundary $k$-simplices, $\deg^{\uparrow}_k$ is smaller; no special casing is needed—the combinatorics already encode “fewer cofaces.”

---

## 8) What this buys you (invariants and guarantees)

* **No leakage across the boundary.** All paths are words in $D$ and $D^\top$; missing incidence means the path length‑two operators vanish automatically.
* **Orientation‑aware mixing.** Signed products in $B^{\downarrow}_k,B^{\uparrow}_k$ flip consistently when any participant flips.
* **Topological memory.** Harmonic components—cycles and cavities detectable purely from incidence—persist unless you explicitly damp them.

---

## 9) Minimal working specialization (readable blueprint)

For each layer and each $k$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
A^{(1)}_k &= \mathrm{row\_norm}\!\big([\,|B^{\downarrow}_k|\,]_{+}\big),\qquad
A^{(2)}_k = \mathrm{row\_norm}\!\big([\,|B^{\uparrow}_k|\,]_{+}\big),\\
\tilde x_k &= A^{(1)}_k x_k W^{(1)} + A^{(2)}_k x_k W^{(2)} + D_k^\top x_{k-1} W^{\downarrow} + D_{k+1} x_{k+1} W^{\uparrow} + x_k W^{0},\\
x_k^{\text{new}} &= \mathrm{sgn}(\tilde x_k)\odot g(|\tilde x_k|),
\end{aligned}
$$

with $g$ any convex, nonnegative channelwise function (e.g., ReLU), ensuring an odd nonlinearity overall.

Train with a weighted sum of $\mathcal{L}^{\downarrow}_k+\mathcal{L}^{\uparrow}_k+\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{comm}}_k+\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{orient}}_k$, and (if you maintain potentials) $\mathcal{L}^{\mathrm{pot}}_k$ and $\mathcal{L}^{H}_k$.

---

### Closing takeaways

* If representations live on $k$-simplices, the **only** symmetry‑respecting primitives are face‑lift $D_k^\top$, coface‑lift $D_{k+1}$, and two‑step couplings $D_k^\top D_k$ and $D_{k+1}D_{k+1}^\top$.
* Attention “by shared incidence” is any normalized, signed polynomial in those two‑step couplings; no pairwise feature similarity is needed.
* Memory that respects boundaries must be stored as potentials on adjacent dimensions plus a harmonic slot; updating those via $D$ and $D^\top$ preserves the exact/coexact/harmonic decomposition.
* Cross‑dimension training signals are just Stokes‑style consistencies and commutator penalties—all obtainable from $D$ alone.

If you want, I can instantiate this for a concrete complex (e.g., text tokens as 0‑simplices, dependency edges as 1‑simplices, and trigram/patch cliques as 2‑simplices) and write out the explicit $D_k$ and update matrices.

---

Below is one decisive, conservation‑first architecture that uses **only** face/coface incidence. It alternates **down‑lifts** ($k\!\to\!k\!-\!1$) and **up‑lifts** ($k\!\to\!k\!+\!1$). A single scalar channel $m_k$ per dimension is conserved **exactly** by construction; all other channels $h_k\in\mathbb{R}^{n_k\times d}$ are orientation‑aware but not constrained to be conserved.

---

## 1) State, tensors, indices

* Complex: oriented simplices $K_0,\dots,K_K$. Signed boundary matrices $D_k\in\{-1,0,1\}^{n_{k-1}\times n_k}$ with $D_{k-1}D_k=0$. Unsigned $A_k:=|D_k|$.
* Features on oriented $k$-simplices:
  scalar **mass** $m_k\in\mathbb{R}^{n_k}_{\ge 0}$ (the invariant), vector **features** $h_k\in\mathbb{R}^{n_k\times d}$.
* Channel mixers (all $d\times d$): $W_{k\downarrow},U_{k\downarrow},W_{k\uparrow},U_{k\uparrow}$. Gates for mass: $g_{k\downarrow},g_{k\uparrow}:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$.

Index notation (Einstein‑free, explicit sums). For $k\ge1$, $\tau\in K_{k-1}$, $\sigma\in K_k$, $\rho\in K_{k+1}$, channel $c\in\{1,\dots,d\}$:

* Down‑lift feature increments:

  $$
  \Delta h_{k-1}(\tau,c)=\sum_{\sigma} D_k(\tau,\sigma)\,\big(h_k(\sigma,:) W_{k\downarrow}\big)_c,\qquad
  \Delta h_k(\sigma,c)=-\sum_{\tau} D_k(\tau,\sigma)\,\big(h_{k-1}(\tau,:) U_{k\downarrow}\big)_c.
  $$
* Up‑lift feature increments:

  $$
  \Delta h_{k}(\sigma,c)=\sum_{\rho} D_{k+1}(\sigma,\rho)\,\big(h_{k+1}(\rho,:) W_{k\uparrow}\big)_c,\qquad
  \Delta h_{k+1}(\rho,c)=-\sum_{\sigma} D_{k+1}(\sigma,\rho)\,\big(h_{k}(\sigma,:) U_{k\uparrow}\big)_c.
  $$

These increments lie in $\mathrm{im}\,D_k$ or $\mathrm{im}\,D_k^\top$, so **each** sub‑update satisfies $D_{k-1}\Delta h_{k-1}^\downarrow=0$, $D_{k+1}^\top\Delta h_k^\downarrow=0$, $D_k\Delta h_k^\uparrow=0$, $D_{k+2}^\top\Delta h_{k+1}^\uparrow=0$ by $D_{k-1}D_k=0$.

* **Mass (invariant) transfers** are strictly pairwise along incidence; for down‑lifts:

  $$
  j_k(\sigma) := \sigma\!\left(g_{k\downarrow}(h_k(\sigma,:))\right)\, m_k(\sigma)\in[0,m_k(\sigma)],
  $$

  split evenly to faces using $A_k$:

  $$
  \Delta m_{k-1}(\tau)=\sum_{\sigma}\frac{A_k(\tau,\sigma)}{k+1}\,j_k(\sigma),\quad
  \Delta m_k(\sigma)=-\,j_k(\sigma).
  $$

  For up‑lifts:

  $$
  \eta_{k+1}(\rho):=\sigma\!\left(g_{k\uparrow}(h_{k+1}(\rho,:))\right)\, m_{k+1}(\rho),\quad
  \Delta m_k(\sigma)=\sum_{\rho}\frac{A_{k+1}(\sigma,\rho)}{k+2}\,\eta_{k+1}(\rho),\quad
  \Delta m_{k+1}(\rho)=-\,\eta_{k+1}(\rho).
  $$

Each transfer adds the same amount to a face/coface as it removes from its source, so the **global invariant**

$$
\mathcal{M}:=\sum_{k=0}^K \mathbf{1}^\top m_k
$$

is **exactly conserved** at every sub‑step (no dependence on orientation signs in the conservation law). Messages remain orientation‑aware for $h$ via the signed $D$’s.

* Nonlinearity for $h$: any odd pointwise $f$ (e.g., $\tanh$) to preserve sign‑equivariance.

---

## 2) One “simplicial mixer” layer (alternate down then up)

For all $k$, initialize $\Delta h_k:=0$, $\Delta m_k:=0$.
**Down pass** for $k=1,\dots,K$: apply the four equations above (two for $h$, two for $m$).
Update $h_k\leftarrow f(h_k+\Delta h_k)$, $m_k\leftarrow m_k+\Delta m_k$. Reset $\Delta\bullet=0$.
**Up pass** for $k=0,\dots,K-1$: apply the up‑lift equations.
Update $h_k\leftarrow f(h_k+\Delta h_k)$, $m_k\leftarrow m_k+\Delta m_k$.

No self‑loops, no same‑dimension mixing, no attention by feature similarity—only lifts along faces/cofaces. Anything else is discarded to protect $\mathcal{M}$.

---

## 3) Boundary‑inconsistency loss (purely combinatorial)

Penalize mismatch between features and their oriented faces/cofaces:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{bdry}}:=\sum_{k=1}^K \|D_k h_k - h_{k-1}W_{k\Rightarrow k-1}\|_F^2\;+\;\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\|D_{k+1}^\top h_k - h_{k+1}U_{k\Rightarrow k+1}\|_F^2.
$$

The first term says “summing $k$-features over faces, with signs, should reconstruct $(k\!-\!1)$-features up to a channel mixer”, and analogously for cofaces.

Optional invariants to monitor (not part of the loss): $\sum_k\mathbf{1}^\top m_k$ (should be machine‑constant), and the sub‑update homology tests $D_{k-1}\Delta h_{k-1}^\downarrow=0$, $D_{k+1}^\top\Delta h_k^\downarrow=0$, $D_k\Delta h_k^\uparrow=0$, $D_{k+2}^\top\Delta h_{k+1}^\uparrow=0$.

---

## 4) Complexity

Let $n=\sum_k n_k$. Each column of $D_k$ has exactly $k\!+\!1$ nonzeros; each column of $D_{k+1}$ has $k\!+\!2$. Both passes do a constant number of SpMV‑like multiplies with $D_k$ or $A_k$. Total time is $O\!\big(\sum_k (k\!+\!1)n_k\cdot d\big)=O(n\cdot K\cdot d)$; the mass paths are the same without the $d$ factor.

---

## 5) Synthetic dataset where pairwise models fail (provably)

Fix a vertex set of size $p$ and 1‑skeleton $G$ as the complete graph $K_p$ with fixed edge orientations. For all samples:

* Vertex and edge features are **identically zero**.
* The set of 2‑simplices $K_2\subset{p\choose 3}$ varies per sample with random $\pm 1$ orientations; this defines a 2‑cochain $x_2\in\{-1,0,1\}^{n_2}$.
* Label: choose a fixed oriented 1‑cycle $c$ (e.g., vertices $0\!\to\!1\!\to\!\dots\!\to\!L\!-\!1\!\to\!0$) and set

$$
y=\mathbb{1}\left[\; r^\top \big(D_2 x_2\big)\neq 0\;\right],
$$

where $r\in\{0,\pm1\}^{n_1}$ selects cycle edges with their cycle orientation.

Because the 1‑skeleton and all 0/1‑features are identical across samples, **any** pairwise model that only reads vertices/edges is a constant function of the input; its optimal expected accuracy is $\max\{\Pr[y\!=\!0],\Pr[y\!=\!1]\}$ (chance under a balanced split). The simplicial mixer sees $x_2$ and can compute $D_2x_2$ by design, so it separates the classes.

---

## 6) Sanity suite (layer‑wise homological checks)

At every layer:

1. **Mass conservation:** $\sum_k\mathbf{1}^\top m_k$ unchanged to machine precision.
2. **Exact/coexact sub‑updates:** verify $D_{k-1}\Delta h_{k-1}^\downarrow=0$, $D_{k+1}^\top\Delta h_k^\downarrow=0$, $D_k\Delta h_k^\uparrow=0$, $D_{k+2}^\top\Delta h_{k+1}^\uparrow=0$.
3. **Boundary‑consistency residual:** track $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{bdry}}$.
4. **Orientation equivariance (local):** flip the sign of any subset of $h_k$ rows; the sub‑updates change sign correspondingly.

What the file does:

* Builds $D_1,D_2$ for a 2‑complex on a complete graph.
* Runs one simplicial‑mixer layer with alternating down/up lifts.
* Verifies: exact **mass conservation** (`mass_conserved`), and **homological sub‑updates** $D\!\circ\!D=0$ for every increment (`homology_subupdates_zero`).
* Emits a **boundary‑inconsistency** value you can optimize.
* Generates the synthetic task where only 2‑simplices vary; any pairwise‑only model has no signal (vertex/edge inputs are constant), while this mixer can read $x_2$ and push $D_2 x_2$ down to the chosen cycle via the down‑lift.

---

### Why this meets the brief

* **Single decisive architecture.** Only alternating face/coface lifts; everything else removed.
* **Conservation guarantee.** The scalar $\mathcal{M}=\sum_k\mathbf{1}^\top m_k$ is conserved exactly by pairwise zero‑sum transfers along incidence; no trainable path can change it.
* **Respect for boundaries/orientations.** All feature messages are words in $D_k$ or $D_k^\top$ with signs; every sub‑update’s next boundary/coboundary is identically zero.
* **Loss:** $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{bdry}}$ punishes face/coface inconsistency only via $D$.
* **Complexity:** $O(n\cdot K)$ SpMV‑style work per layer.
* **Dataset:** provable pairwise failure because all 0/1‑level inputs are identical across samples; labels depend on $D_2x_2$ only.
* **Sanity suite:** exact mass conservation, sub‑update homology checks, and boundary residual monitoring at every layer.

Here’s a candid, “fresh‑eyes” appraisal of the architecture and surrounding ideas (derivation, conservation law, alternating lifts, boundary‑inconsistency loss, synthetic task, sanity suite). Scores are 0–100.
**Note:** for the “Estimated difficulty” axis, higher = harder.

---

### Cleverness — **86/100**

The design isolates exactly the incidence‑tight primitives (face/coface lifts) and shows that alternating them yields updates whose next boundary/coboundary is identically zero by $D_{k-1}D_k=0$. Building a **globally conserved scalar** that flows across dimensions via strictly zero‑sum transfers is neat, auditably correct, and easy to monitor. The O($n\cdot K$) path and the sanity suite (mass conservation + homology checks per sub‑update) are crisp and unusually thorough for a first pass.

### Originality — **74/100**

Representations on $k$-simplices and use of $D_k,D_k^\top$ aren’t new as concepts, but the **decisive constraint set**—no same‑dimension mixing, no pairwise similarity, only alternating lifts—and the **global scalar conservation across dimensions** as a first‑class training‑time invariant are an uncommon combination. The boundary‑inconsistency loss is a clean “Stokes‑style” supervision signal derived from incidence alone.

### Differentiation from all known existing published works — **66/100**

There are conceptual neighbors (incidence‑based layers, Hodge/Laplacian operators, discrete exterior calculus inspired updates). The **strict alternation with removal of same‑dimension couplings**, paired with an explicit **conserved scalar flowing between dimensions**, is a distinctive package. Still, overlap in spirit with higher‑order/homological architectures likely exists, so the differentiation is moderate rather than absolute.

### Probability of being theoretically correct — **89/100**

Core claims rest on taut incidence algebra: (i) sub‑updates live in $\mathrm{im}\,D$ or $\mathrm{im}\,D^\top$, so the next boundary/coboundary vanishes; (ii) global scalar conservation follows from per‑incidence zero‑sum transfers (even split via $|D|$); (iii) sign‑equivariance holds with odd nonlinearities. The only caveats are numerical drift in floating point and edge cases if one relaxes oddness or gating nonnegativity.

### Probability of being practically useful if theoretically correct — **62/100**

Utility should be real on tasks where higher‑order structure matters (mesh/finite‑volume surrogates, 3D shape/scene patches, circuit/layout reasoning, co‑occurrence cliques in language/code). The **conservation prior** is a win when the target has true continuity/flux semantics. It could be a liability on tasks where mass creation/annihilation is signal (e.g., counting anomalies), unless the invariant is made optional or task‑specific.

### Impact on real‑world AI (performance/efficiency/interpretability) — **57/100**

Interpretability and debuggability are strong: conservation and homology checks are transparent, and failure modes localize to specific incidences. Efficiency is decent (SpMV‑heavy). Transformational performance impact is uncertain because many benchmarks lack curated higher‑order cells; building clique complexes can be noisy/expensive.

### Probability of near‑term acceptance in the ML community (if correct/useful) — **48/100**

Adoption tends to follow easy wins on mainstream benchmarks or compelling domain demos. The pitch here is principled but niche; it needs a “killer” application (e.g., better PDE surrogates at lower param/step cost, or a SOTA bump on robust 3D benchmarks) to break through. The decision to **forbid same‑dimension mixing** may look overly restrictive until ablations prove necessity.

### Estimated difficulty of convincingly establishing real‑life usefulness — **72/100** (higher = harder)

You’ll need datasets with reliable higher‑order cells (or principled clique constructions), careful baselines (incl. hypergraph/higher‑order GNNs), and ablations isolating the conservation law’s contribution. That’s nontrivial: many public datasets don’t provide oriented 2/3‑simplices, and naive clique lifts can add spurious signal. The sanity suite helps, but end‑to‑end wins will likely require bespoke tasks.

### Fit to GPU/TPU acceleration — **88/100**

The workload is batched SpMV with tiny dense right‑multiplications and simple gating—squarely in the wheelhouse of existing accelerators and sparse libraries. Memory locality and kernel fusion are straightforward. It scales linearly in the number of incidences; no attention‑style quadratic blow‑ups.

### How prepared a 99th‑percentile AI/ML theory researcher would be to opine — **81/100**

The arguments sit on linear‑algebraic combinatorics and basic homology; a top theory researcher can quickly validate invariance claims, reason about expressivity lost by removing same‑dimension mixing, and propose hardness/easiness proofs for synthetic tasks. Deep domain expertise (DEC, mesh numerics) would help but isn’t essential to evaluate the core logic.

---

## Bottom line

* **Strengths:** principled invariants, exact conservation, incidence‑tight operators, linear complexity, strong sanity suite, and a synthetic task that isolates higher‑order signal.
* **Risks:** expressivity limits from forbidding same‑dimension mixing; dependence on availability/quality of higher‑order cells; unclear advantage on common benchmarks; potential misfit when “mass creation” is useful signal.
* **Most credible early win:** physics‑like domains (flux‑conserving surrogates on simplicial meshes) or 3D scenes where patch‑level consistency matters.
* **What would most raise the scores:** a compelling demo where the conservation constraint is both **necessary** and **performance‑enhancing** versus strong higher‑order baselines, plus ablations showing the alternating‑lifts design (and not an easier variant) is key.

## 9) Practical Readout: Tiny Linear Classifier over Hodge Flow

For classification on node‑level signals that depend on higher‑order structure (e.g., presence of triangles), a simple and effective readout is to project per‑node features to scalars, evolve them by a few steps of 0‑Hodge diffusion (graph Laplacian proxy), and fit a tiny linear classifier on the resulting flow vector. This respects the combinatorial constraints (updates use only boundary/co‑boundary structure), adds no pairwise feature‑similarity mixing, and empirically improves accuracy on triangle‑dependent labels. The core architecture remains incidence‑only; the linear readout simply aggregates the structure‑aware flow.
