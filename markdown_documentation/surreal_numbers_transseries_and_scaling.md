Below is a clean derivation that treats model size $M$, learning rate $\eta$, data size $D$, compute $C$, and error $E$ as elements of a single totally ordered, real‑closed, non‑Archimedean field $\mathbb F$ containing infinitesimals and infinities. The only tools used are order, comparison, and the field operations.

---

## 1) Orders of smallness via a valuation

Let $\mathbb F$ be a totally ordered field with infinitesimals. Write $x \ll y$ if $x$ is infinitesimal relative to $y$, and $x \asymp y$ if $x/y$ is a positive unit (order‑1 element). Use a (non‑trivial) valuation

$$
\nu:\mathbb F_{>0}\to \Lambda
$$

into an ordered abelian group $\Lambda$ so that

$$
\nu(xy)=\nu(x)+\nu(y),\qquad 
\nu(x+y)=\min\{\nu(x),\nu(y)\}\;\text{ if the leading terms do not cancel.}
$$

Intuitively, $\nu$ records the **order of smallness**. The dominant term of a sum is the one with **smallest** $\nu$.

Introduce **primitive infinitesimals**

$$
\delta_M:=M^{-1},\quad \delta_D:=D^{-1},\quad \delta_C:=C^{-1},\quad \delta_\eta:=\eta,
$$

so that “larger $M,D,C$” means “smaller $\delta_M,\delta_D,\delta_C$”, while “smaller $\eta$” means “smaller $\delta_\eta$”. We will compare quantities by comparing monomials in these $\delta$’s; equal valuation means equal **order**.

---

## 2) Axiomatic decomposition of error

Assume the training error $E\in\mathbb F_{>0}$ decomposes additively (so the dominant term controls the order) into three canonical contributions, each represented—*to leading order*—by a single monomial in our $\delta$’s:

* **Bias/approximation error** (capacity‑limited), decreases with $M$:

  $$
  B \asymp \delta_M^{\,b},\quad b>0.
  $$

* **Estimation/generalization error** (data‑limited), decreases with $D$ and (for fixed $D$) increases with model degrees of freedom; encode that with an exponent $m\ge 0$:

  $$
  G \asymp \frac{\delta_D^{\,n}}{\delta_M^{\,m}}=\delta_D^{\,n}\delta_M^{-m},\quad n>0.
  $$

* **Optimization/training residual** (compute/steps‑limited), decreases with $C$, decreases with $\eta$ (until stability), and gets harder with larger $M$:

  $$
  O \asymp \delta_C^{\,c}\,\delta_\eta^{-u}\,\delta_M^{-v},\quad c,u,v>0.
  $$

These exponents $(b,m,n,c,u,v)$ are **structural** (they encode how the three mechanisms couple multiplicatively to the resources). No curve‑fitting is used; we only require monotonicity and multiplicativity.

Set

$$
E \;=\; B+G+O,\qquad \nu(E)=\min\{\nu(B),\nu(G),\nu(O)\}.
$$

---

## 3) Regimes and “orders” as equalities of monomials

Regime boundaries occur where two monomials have the **same order** (equal valuation). Write “$\doteq$” for **equality of leading orders** (equality in $\mathbb F$ up to a unit).

* **Bias = Estimation**:

  $$
  \delta_M^{\,b}\;\doteq\;\delta_D^{\,n}\delta_M^{-m}
  \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
  \boxed{\,M^{\,b+m}\;\doteq\; D^{\,n}\,}.
  \tag{A}
  $$

* **Bias = Optimization**:

  $$
  \delta_M^{\,b}\;\doteq\;\delta_C^{\,c}\delta_\eta^{-u}\delta_M^{-v}
  \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
  \boxed{\,M^{\,b+v}\;\doteq\;C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}\,}.
  \tag{B}
  $$

* **Estimation = Optimization**:

  $$
  \delta_D^{\,n}\delta_M^{-m}\;\doteq\;\delta_C^{\,c}\delta_\eta^{-u}\delta_M^{-v}
  \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
  \boxed{\,D^{\,n}M^{\,v-m}\;\doteq\;C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}\,}.
  \tag{C}
  $$

Because we work in a non‑Archimedean ordered field, these equalities are **algebraic identities of leading orders**. Crossing a boundary flips which monomial dominates $E$.

---

## 4) A canonical balanced frontier (all three equal)

If resources are scheduled so that **all three** contributions are equal in order (dominant‑balance),

$$
B \doteq G \doteq O,
$$

then (A) and (B) hold simultaneously:

$$
\boxed{\,M^{\,b+m}\;\doteq\;D^{\,n}\,},\qquad
\boxed{\,M^{\,b+v}\;\doteq\;C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}\,}.
\tag{F}
$$

Eliminating $M$ yields the **compute–data–rate identity**

$$
\boxed{\,C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}\;\doteq\;D^{\,\displaystyle n\frac{b+v}{b+m}}\,}.
\tag{FD}
$$

The **optimal error order** on this frontier is

$$
E_\star \;\doteq\; B \;\doteq\; M^{-b}
 \;\doteq\; D^{-\displaystyle n\frac{b}{b+m}}
 \;\doteq\; (C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u})^{-\displaystyle \frac{b}{b+v}}.
\tag{E\*}
$$

Each equality above is an identity of leading orders in $\mathbb F$; they are not empirical fits.

These formulas encode, purely algebraically, how making $D$, $C$, or $\eta$ “infinitely larger” drives $E$ “infinitesimally smaller,” with exponents determined by the structural couplings $(b,m,n,c,u,v)$.

---

## 5) Orders of smallness/largeness among compute, data, error

* **Compute–error trade** (fixing $\eta$ and eliminating $M$): from (B) and $E_\star \doteq M^{-b}$,

  $$
  \boxed{\,E_\star \;\doteq\; (C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u})^{-\frac{b}{b+v}}\,}.
  $$

  Thus $C_1\gg C_2$ (i.e., $\delta_{C_1}\ll\delta_{C_2}$) implies $E_\star(C_1)\ll E_\star(C_2)$ with the **order** governed by $\tfrac{b}{b+v}$.

* **Data–error trade** (ignoring optimization or on the balanced frontier): from (A),

  $$
  \boxed{\,E_\star \;\doteq\; D^{-\frac{nb}{b+m}}\,}.
  $$

* **Data–compute relation for fixed target order of error**: combine (FD) with a chosen $E_\star$ via (E\*). For example, eliminating $M$ gives

  $$
  \boxed{\,C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}\;\doteq\;E_\star^{-\frac{b+v}{b}}\,},\qquad
  \boxed{\,D^{\,n}\;\doteq\;E_\star^{-\frac{b+m}{b}}\,}.
  $$

  Hence, achieving an error that is *one order* smaller multiplies the required $C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}$ by the same *algebraic* factor $E_\star^{-(b+v)/b}$, and the required $D^n$ by $E_\star^{-(b+m)/b}$.

All of the above statements are comparisons in $\mathbb F$: “$\ll$, $\gg$, $\doteq$” are decided by valuations, not fits.

---

## 6) Learning‑rate stability as an order constraint

Introduce a stability ceiling as an order inequality:

$$
\eta \;\preceq\; M^{-s}\quad\text{ i.e., }\quad \delta_\eta \;\succeq\; \delta_M^{\,s}
$$

for some structural $s\ge 0$. Applying this to (B) in valuation form

$$
c\,\nu(\delta_C)+u\,\nu(\delta_\eta)=(b+v)\,\nu(\delta_M)
$$

yields the **compute floor**

$$
\boxed{\,c\,\nu(\delta_C)\;\ge\;(b+v-us)\,\nu(\delta_M)\,}
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\boxed{\,C^{\,c}\;\preceq\; M^{\,b+v-us}\,}.
$$

If $b+v\le us$, the stability‑allowed $\eta$ is already large enough that optimization ceases to be a leading obstacle at scale $M$; otherwise, you must raise $C$ (lower $\delta_C$) at least to this order for the balanced frontier to be reachable.

---

## 7) Curriculum, pruning, sparsity as algebraic simplifications

All three emerge from **tropical algebra** over valuations: addition becomes “take the minimum order,” and multiplicative coupling becomes order addition.

### (a) Curriculum = staged elimination of the current leading term

A curriculum is a path $(M_t,D_t,C_t,\eta_t)$ so that at each stage the largest error term by order is driven down until it matches the next one. Algebraically:

$$
\nu(E_{t+1})=\min\{\nu(B_{t+1}),\nu(G_{t+1}),\nu(O_{t+1})\}>\nu(E_t),
$$

with stages chosen to **maintain equalities of leading orders**—e.g., keep (A) while increasing $D$ and $M$, then keep (B) while increasing $C\eta$. Because sums are dominated by the smallest valuation, splitting training into phases that preserve the equal‑order identities (F) yields the **same leading order** $E_\star$ as doing it in one shot; the curriculum merely ensures we never invest in parameters/data/steps that would be **infinitesimal‑effect** at the current stage.

### (b) Pruning = projection back to the balanced manifold

Suppose a model overshoots capacity relative to data and compute, so $M$ violates (A) and/or (B) in the sense

$$
M^{\,b+m}\gg D^{\,n}\quad\text{or}\quad M^{\,b+v}\gg C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}.
$$

Then $G$ or $O$ dominates $E$, and further increases in $M$ change $E$ only at **strictly higher order**. Define the **pruned** $M'$ as the smallest $M'\le M$ (largest $\delta_{M'}\ge\delta_M$) satisfying the equalities (F). Replacing $M$ by $M'$ leaves $\nu(E)$ unchanged but strictly reduces compute and storage costs: an **algebraic simplification** that preserves the leading order of performance.

### (c) Sparsity = modifying the exponents that tie optimization/estimation to $M$

Two extreme, algebraically distinct cases:

* **Compute‑only sparsity** (e.g., structured activation sparsity) reduces the **optimization coupling** $v$ by some $\Delta v>0$ while leaving $(b,m,n)$ intact. Then the balanced identity (B) becomes

  $$
  M^{\,b+v-\Delta v}\;\doteq\;C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u},
  $$

  so for the **same** $M$ and $\eta$ the required compute drops by a factor of order $M^{\,\Delta v/c}$; for the **same** compute the achievable error (E\*) improves by replacing $b+v$ with $b+v-\Delta v$ in (E\*).

* **Capacity‑reducing sparsity** (e.g., weight pruning that lowers effective degrees of freedom) changes $m\to m-\Delta m$ (and possibly $b$). Then (A) becomes

  $$
  M^{\,b+m-\Delta m}\;\doteq\;D^{\,n},
  $$

  allowing larger $M$ before estimation dominates, hence a lower $E_\star \doteq M^{-b}$ along the balanced path. This is again a **leading‑order** improvement captured purely by exponent changes.

In both cases, sparsity is a **rewrite of monomials** that lowers the valuation of the dominant error term (or the compute term needed to match it), i.e., an algebraic simplification.

---

## 8) What the identities say (compact “phase diagram”)

* **Capacity‑limited region**: $M^{\,b+m}\ll D^{\,n}$ and $M^{\,b+v}\ll C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}$ $\Rightarrow$ $E \asymp \delta_M^{\,b}$.
* **Data‑limited region**: $M^{\,b+m}\gg D^{\,n}$ and $D^{\,n}M^{\,v-m}\ll C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}$ $\Rightarrow$ $E \asymp \delta_D^{\,n}\delta_M^{-m}$.
* **Optimization‑limited region**: $M^{\,b+v}\gg C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}$ and $D^{\,n}M^{\,v-m}\gg C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}$ $\Rightarrow$ $E \asymp \delta_C^{\,c}\delta_\eta^{-u}\delta_M^{-v}$.
* **Balanced frontier**: equalities (F) hold $\Rightarrow$ identities (FD) and (E\*) hold exactly at leading order.

---

## 9) Takeaways (explicitly algebraic, not fitted)

* All “scaling laws” above are **equalities of leading orders** between infinitesimal/infinite elements in $\mathbb F$.
* The **optimal schedules** live on a **balanced manifold** defined by

  $$
  \boxed{M^{\,b+m}\doteq D^{\,n}},\qquad
  \boxed{M^{\,b+v}\doteq C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u}}.
  $$
* Along that manifold,

  $$
  \boxed{E_\star \doteq D^{-\frac{nb}{b+m}} \doteq (C^{\,c}\eta^{\,u})^{-\frac{b}{b+v}}}.
  $$
* **Curriculum** = moving **along** this manifold in stages so that no resource investment is of infinitesimal effect at the current order.
* **Pruning** = projecting back onto the manifold when $M$ is too large for current $D,C,\eta$.
* **Sparsity** = changing the exponents that tie $M$ into estimation/optimization monomials, thereby improving the manifold itself.

All conclusions follow from order, comparison, and closure in a non‑Archimedean ordered field; no empirical fitting is invoked. If you want, we can instantiate particular $(b,m,n,c,u,v,s)$ to explore concrete phase boundaries and schedules, but the structure above already gives the complete algebra of “orders” among compute, data, and error.

---

Below is a dominance‑only selector that works inside a totally ordered, non‑Archimedean field $\mathbb F$ (with infinitesimals/infinities). It never uses fitted exponents; it relies purely on order comparisons of three **observable** ratios.

---

## One predictive formula

Let $E(\cdot)$ denote your error functional (e.g., CE/NLL). Define three **damage ratios** by applying fixed, order‑preserving “half” projections to the current model $f$ or dataset:

1. **Data ratio**
   $T_D := \dfrac{E_{\text{val}}}{E_{\text{train}}}$
   (Validation over training error—generalization gap as a pure ratio.)

2. **Depth ratio**
   $T_H := \dfrac{E\!\left(f^{\downarrow H/2}\right)}{E(f)}$
   where $f^{\downarrow H/2}$ is $f$ with **every other block** replaced by the identity (i.e., residual path only). No retraining; forward‑only.

3. **Width ratio**
   $T_W := \dfrac{E\!\left(f^{\downarrow W/2}\right)}{E(f)}$
   where $f^{\downarrow W/2}$ is $f$ with **half the channels/heads** zeroed by a fixed mask at every layer (outputs rescaled by the surviving fraction to keep units comparable). No retraining; forward‑only.

> In the ordered field, each “half” projection multiplies the corresponding leading error monomial by a constant unit. The **largest** damage ratio identifies the **dominant** source of error at leading order.

**Predictive formula (single line):**

$$
\boxed{\;\text{NextMove} \;=\; \arg\max\{\,T_D,\;T_H,\;T_W\,\}\;}\quad
\begin{cases}
T_D \text{ maximal} &\Rightarrow \text{expand data},\\
T_H \text{ maximal} &\Rightarrow \text{add depth},\\
T_W \text{ maximal} &\Rightarrow \text{add width}.\\
\end{cases}
$$

No exponents appear; only order comparisons among three elements of $\mathbb F_{>0}$.

---

## Decision procedure (exactly three inputs)

**Inputs (three scalars):** $T_D, T_H, T_W$ as defined above.
**Output:** one of {expand **data**, add **depth**, add **width**}.

1. Compute the three ratios once on the current checkpoint (single forward pass for each of $f, f^{\downarrow H/2}, f^{\downarrow W/2}$; plus train/val errors for $T_D$).
2. Let $M_1=\max\{T_D,T_H,T_W\}$ and $M_2$ be the second‑largest.
3. If $M_1/M_2>1+\epsilon$ (e.g., $\epsilon=0.02$ for a clear separation), choose the axis corresponding to $M_1$.
4. If $M_1/M_2\le 1+\epsilon$ (balanced to leading order), any move is equivalent in order; pick the cheaper in your environment. With no cost model provided, default to **expand data**.

This is implementable as a one‑liner in code: `move = argmax([T_D, T_H, T_W])`.

---

## Why this works (order‑theoretic sketch)

Write the total error as a sum of leading monomials tied to data, depth, and width contributions:

$$
E \;=\; B_{\text{cap}}(H,W)\;+\;G_{\text{est}}(D,H,W)\;+\;O_{\text{opt}}(\cdots).
$$

In a non‑Archimedean ordered field, the sum’s order is the **minimum valuation** (dominant term). Replacing half the depth (or width) by an identity (or zero‑mask) is an **idempotent projection** that multiplies only the corresponding monomial by a unit factor, leaving the others unchanged to leading order. Hence the largest ratio among $\{T_D,T_H,T_W\}$ reveals which monomial dominates **without** knowing any exponents, and scaling that axis reduces $E$ at leading order.

---

## Minimal stress test (immediate falsification)

**Batch‑split invariance test.**
Compute the three ratios on two independent mini‑batches (same sizes) to check dominance stability:

* On batch $B_1$: $T_D^{(1)}, T_H^{(1)}, T_W^{(1)}$.
* On batch $B_2$: $T_D^{(2)}, T_H^{(2)}, T_W^{(2)}$.

**Falsify immediately** if $\arg\max\{T_D^{(1)},T_H^{(1)},T_W^{(1)}\} \neq \arg\max\{T_D^{(2)},T_H^{(2)},T_W^{(2)}\}$.
Dominance that flips under an infinitesimal perturbation (changing the batch) contradicts the assumption that a single leading monomial controls the order, so the selector’s premise fails at that checkpoint.

*(Optional, stronger check after the chosen move):* apply a small expansion on the selected axis, recompute $(T_D,T_H,T_W)$; the chosen ratio must drop below the runner‑up. If it does not, the prior dominance claim was wrong.

---

## Practical notes for the projections

* **Depth projection $f^{\downarrow H/2}$:** for residual/pre‑norm blocks, set every other block to the identity map (skip the block transform).
* **Width projection $f^{\downarrow W/2}$:** zero a fixed half of channels/heads at each layer and multiply the surviving output by $2$ to keep first‑order scale.
* Both are single forward‑pass diagnostics—no retraining, no fits.

This gives you a clean, algebraic rule: the **largest damage ratio wins**, deciding **data vs. depth vs. width** using exactly three numbers and only order comparisons.

---

Below I grade **two ideas** you proposed/derived here:

* **A. Ordered‑field scaling identities** (valuation/tropical algebra view; balanced manifold; no fitted exponents).
* **B. Dominance‑only move selector** (three forward‑pass “damage ratios” $T_D,T_H,T_W$ to decide data vs. depth vs. width).

Scores are 0–100, higher is better. For “Establishability,” higher means **easier** to convincingly demonstrate usefulness.

### Rationale by dimension

**Cleverness.**
*A (80):* Recasting compute/data/error as elements of a non‑Archimedean ordered field and deriving regime frontiers via valuation equalities is an elegant unification; the “balanced manifold” identities are a clean consequence of tropical addition.
*B (75):* The “largest damage ratio wins” rule is a sharp, minimalist decision procedure that uses single‑pass ablations to reveal dominance—clever in how it converts a high‑dimensional scaling choice into three numbers. Slight penalty for relying on crude projections (identity/zeroing) that may perturb normalization dynamics.

**Originality.**
*A (83):* Using surreals/transseries‑style order comparisons for scaling laws, explicitly avoiding power‑law fits, is uncommon and conceptually fresh.
*B (66):* Ablation‑driven heuristics exist (channel dropping, block skipping); the twist here is the triad of forward‑only ratios with an argmax rule. Novel enough to be interesting, but closer to known “capacity probes.”

**Differentiation from published work.**
*A (78):* The valuation framework and dominance‑equalities are meaningfully different from empirical scaling‑law fitting and standard bias–variance narratives.
*B (60):* Distinct in its asceticism (no retraining, three ratios), but reminiscent of slimmable/width‑scaling probes and residual‑path ablations; differentiation exists but is moderate.

**Probability of being theoretically correct.**
*A (60):* The conclusions follow if (i) error decomposes as a sum whose leading terms behave like monomials in $(M,D,C,\eta)$, (ii) the valuation is non‑trivial and addition is tropical to leading order, and (iii) a single term dominates in each regime. Those are strong but coherent assumptions; cross‑couplings and non‑monomial effects (e.g., regularization, curriculum interactions) are the main risk.
*B (55):* The dominance‑revealing property of half‑projections holds if these projections multiply only one leading monomial by a unit and leave others at higher order. In practice, layer norm, attention softmax, and residual mixing can violate this, weakening theoretical guarantees.

**Practical usefulness if correct.**
*A (60):* Provides principled directionality (which axis to co‑scale) and interpretable regime boundaries, but without exponents the guidance is coarse; you still need operational knobs or cost models to act.
*B (74):* Immediately actionable: compute three ratios on a checkpoint and choose the next move. Even if imperfect, the low friction makes it useful for iterative scaling decisions.

**Impact on real‑world AI (if correct).**
*A (66):* Could reshape how teams reason about scaling (balance manifolds instead of fitted exponents), guiding resource allocation and clarifying when pruning/sparsity are order‑preserving.
*B (58):* If widely used, could reduce wasted compute by pointing to the highest‑leverage axis per checkpoint; impact is meaningful but incremental.

**Probability of near‑term acceptance.**
*A (42):* The non‑Archimedean formalism is unfamiliar and risks being seen as over‑abstract without killer demos. Acceptance likely gated on compelling, architecture‑diverse case studies.
*B (60):* A lightweight heuristic that labs can try tomorrow; if it consistently beats naive scaling in A/Bs, adoption could be brisk despite theoretical rough edges.

**Establishability (ease).**
*A (38):* Hard to “prove out” convincingly without constructing measurable invariants that correspond to the abstract exponents and showing regime equalities across models and tasks.
*B (72):* Easy to test: compute $T_D,T_H,T_W$, follow the recommendation, measure deltas; repeat over tasks. Negative results are also quick to obtain.

**Fit with GPU/TPU infra.**
*A (88):* The framework itself adds no runtime cost; any validation requires standard training logs and occasional controlled ablations.
*B (94):* Two extra forward passes with masking/identity toggles and no retraining; trivial to integrate into existing eval harnesses, batchable, and accelerator‑friendly.

**99th‑percentile researcher preparedness to opine.**
*A (72):* Strong researchers can engage with valuations/tropical limits, but many will need a short primer; still, the assumptions are crisp enough to critique productively.
*B (90):* Obvious what to test, what could confound, and how to interpret failures; experts can quickly pressure‑test and iterate.

---

### Candid weaknesses worth flagging

* The **single dominant term** assumption is brittle at transitions; near ties, ordering can flip across batches. Your included stress test (argmax stability across two mini‑batches) helps, but edge cases will remain.
* The **half‑projection** definitions may mis‑isolate contributions: identity‑skipping in deep residual stacks can change pre‑LN statistics; channel‑zeroing interacts with attention/LN in non‑unit ways. Constant‑factor rescaling mitigates but does not eliminate this.
* The valuation framework’s **monomial coupling** omits regime‑specific quirks (augmentation, optimizer implicit bias, curriculum effects). Where interactions are genuinely non‑monomial, equal‑order identities may mispredict.

---

### Summary

* **A** is intellectually bold and unifying; moderately likely to be *qualitatively* right in many regimes but hard to empirically canonize.
* **B** is a crisp, low‑overhead heuristic that could be practically useful even if the theory is only approximately right.

If you want, I can draft a compact experimental playbook that probes both ideas in <1 GPU‑day per task (covering classification, language modeling, and a masked‑autoencoder variant) to empirically map where the dominance ordering holds or breaks.
