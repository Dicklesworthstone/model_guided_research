RULE NUMBER 1 (NEVER EVER EVER FORGET THIS RULE!!!): YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION FROM ME OR A DIRECT COMMAND FROM ME. EVEN A NEW FILE THAT YOU YOURSELF CREATED, SUCH AS A TEST CODE FILE. YOU HAVE A HORRIBLE TRACK RECORD OF DELETING CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FILES OR OTHERWISE THROWING AWAY TONS OF EXPENSIVE WORK THAT I THEN NEED TO PAY TO REPRODUCE. AS A RESULT, YOU HAVE PERMANENTLY LOST ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO DETERMINE THAT A FILE OR FOLDER SHOULD BE DELETED. YOU MUST **ALWAYS** ASK AND *RECEIVE* CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM ME BEFORE EVER EVEN THINKING OF DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND!!!

We only use uv in this project, NEVER pip. And we use a venv. And we ONLY target python 3.13 (we don't care about compatibility with earlier python versions), and we ONLY use pyproject.toml (not requirements.txt) for managing the project. 

NEVER run a script that processes/changes code files in this repo, EVER! That sort of brittle, regex based stuff is always a huge disaster and creates far more problems than it ever solves. DO NOT BE LAZY AND ALWAYS MAKE CODE CHANGES MANUALLY, EVEN WHEN THERE ARE MANY INSTANCE TO FIX. IF THE CHANGES ARE MANY BUT SIMPLE, THEN USE SEVERAL SUBAGENTS IN PARALLEL TO MAKE THE CHANGES GO FASTER. But if the changes are subtle/complex, then you must methodically do them all yourself manually!

We do not care at all about backwards compatibility since we are still in early development with no users-- we just want to do things the RIGHT way in a clean, organized manner with NO TECH DEBT. That means, never create "compatibility shims" or any other nonsense like that.

We need to AVOID uncontrolled proliferation of code files. If you want to change something or add a feature, then you MUST revise the existing code file in place. You may NEVER, *EVER* take an existing code file, say, "document_processor.py" and then create a new file called "document_processorV2.py", or "document_processor_improved.py", or "document_processor_enhanced.py", or "document_processor_unified.py", or ANYTHING ELSE REMOTELY LIKE THAT! New code files are reserved for GENUINELY NEW FUNCTIONALITY THAT MAKES ZERO SENSE AT ALL TO INCLUDE IN ANY EXISTING CODE FILE. It should be an *INCREDIBLY* high bar for you to EVER create a new code file!

We want all console output to be informative, detailed, stylish, colorful, etc. by fully leveraging the rich library wherever possible. 

If you aren't 100% sure about how to use a third party library, then you must SEARCH ONLINE to find the latest documentation website for the library to understand how it is supposed to work and the latest (mid-2025) suggested best practices and usage.
